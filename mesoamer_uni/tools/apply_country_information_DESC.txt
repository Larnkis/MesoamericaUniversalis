This text file is a description of a script that would save at the very least 1 week of arduous text file editing.

The intention of the script is to replace the contents of culturally identified files in the directory 
	"mesoamer_uni/common/countries"
A step by step breakdown of how the script is envisioned to work in the case of a single file is as follows:
	1: Inside the script of the program, the user defines a string variable named "search_culture" 
		as the culture they wish to work on. In this example the user has entered the culture "mexica" 
		as the value of the search_culture variable. 
		
	2: The program looks into the directory "mesoamer_uni/history/countries", assumed in this example to be 
		organized alphabetically.
		
	3: The program searchs each file for the line "primary_culture = [search_culture]". In this case search_culture
		is defined as "mexica", so the program will look through a large number of files before finding the first
		file meeting these conditions, which, assuming alphabetical organization, should be "AAA - Tenochtitlan.txt". 
		
	4: The program deduces the place-name of the file. Using the example of "AAA - Tenochtitlan.txt",
		the place-name would be simply "Tenochtitlan".
		
	5: The program searchs the directory "mesoamer_uni/common/countries" for a file with the name "Tenochtitlan.txt" 
	
	6: Upon finding this exact file, the program will replace the entire contents, STARTING
		at the line "historical_idea_groups" within the file so as not to overwrite the country map color, 
		of "Tenochtitlan.txt" with text defined by the user within the script. 
		This text will take the same structural form as the text currently in each of the files 
		in "mesoamer_uni/common/countries", but with customized culture specific 
		information in the fields "historical_idea_groups", "historical_units", "monarch_names", "leader_names",
		"ship_names", "army_names", and "fleet_names". This will probably constitute 3,000-5,000 characters of 
		text depending on the culture. 
		
	7: The process begins again at step 2, only this time using Tenochtitlan as the starting point. It should 
		scan all files in "mesoamer_uni/history/countries" for any instances of primary_culture being equal 
		to mexica.
