/u/Ucumu, /u/Cozijo, and /u/400-Rabbits

Paradox and the whole EU4 team for 
actually making the game for us to mod.

All the historians and archeologists who have 
done excellent work in advancing the field of
Mesoamerican studies and providing an 
increasingly better picture of the amazing and all too
often overlooked civilizations of the area.
