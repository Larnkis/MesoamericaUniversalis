 sideaevents1.d: "We may choose to hold one of several types of festivals, depending on our aims. \nA military parade will increase army tradition and militancy as well as temporarily boosting infantry combat ability. \nA festival of lords will increase legitimacy and temporarily reduce global autonomy. \nA festival for the commons will increase legitimacy and temporarily reduce global unrest."

 sideaevents2.t: "Grand Military Parade!"
 sideaevents2.d: "Today our warriors, outfitted in their best robes and armor, marched through $CAPITAL_CITY$, flanked by crowds of admiring citizens. Several soldiers performed feats of strength for the crowd, and our best leaders were exalted. Young boys were particularly impressed by the procession and will likely be fencing with sticks for months to come and be more obedient if they are chosen to train for war. Truly, we have impressed the populous and boosted their enthusiasm for warfare."
 sideaevents2.a: "Glorious!"
 
 sideaevents3.t: "Festival of Lords!"
 sideaevents3.d: "Every lord of significant power, and many more of the petty variety, has gathered in the central district $CAPITAL_CITY$ for a grand feast. Long tables have been laid out with the finest foods; fresh fish rushed all the way from the oceans, rich quantities of duck, dog, and turkey, avocados, tomatoes, many varieties of tortillas, and cups have been filled with hot chocolate or pulque. The lords are surely impressed by the power of a ruler who is capable of organizing such a feast for them and will be more receptive to central control for some time."
 sideaevents3.a: "Delicious!"
 
 sideaevents4.t: "Festival of Commons!"
 sideaevents4.d: "Commoners from all across the realm have been informed of a great festival to be held in $CAPITAL_CITY$, and many have arrived, to find the city resplendent and decorated with all manner of banners and symbols. Enormous tables have been laid out, covered in food brought from other realms or farmed near the capital, including maize, chile peppers, several types of tortilla, beans, squash, turkey, and more. Entertainers, musicians, orators, and poets put on displays, and soldiers remind everyone that great lord $MONARCH$ is maintaining order among the festivities. The people are very impressed by the generosity and power of $MONARCH$."
 sideaevents4.a: "Very good."
