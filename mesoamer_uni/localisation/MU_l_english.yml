 expanddip1:0 "Expanded Diplomatic Network"
 expanddip1_desc:0 "By expanding the functions of our diplomatic network we can more efficiently manage the burdens of being a tributary state, whether they be alliances or control over more subservients."

 elaboratecapital_desc:0 "Using our ‘extracted’ riches we can decorate our capital and show everyone just how wealthy and powerful we are."
 showsofstrength:0 "Shows of Strength"
 showsofstrength_desc:0 "Regularly flaunting our military prowess will help keep our subjects in line."
 betterinfrastructure:0 "Improved Infrastructure"
 betterinfrastructure_desc:0 "Improving the infrastructure in our territory and our subjects territory will provide a variety of benefits, including lower travel times for our diplomats and better supplies for our troops, both of which are significant boons to our tribute state."
 ambassadorcorps:0 "Ambassador Corps"
 ambassadorcorps_desc:0 "Keeping good relations with our subjects requires an army of trained ambassadors."
 tribtrade:0 "Tributary Trading Network"
 tribtrade_desc:0 "Promoting the rich trade network we control that our subjects will have the privilege of participating in will make us richer and keep our subjects loyal."
 bigstick:0 "Big Stick"
 bigstick_desc:0 "Perhaps the best weapon in our loyalty maintenance arsenal is, well, our weapons. Having more weapons and men to wield them never hurts, and luckily we have a significant agricultural population that we can mobilize if needed."
 
 directconquest_ideas:0 "Direct Conquest"
 directconquest_ideas_bonus:0 "Full Direct Conquest"
 conqueststate:0 "Conquest State"
 conqueststate_desc:0 "If we wish to directly conquer our enemies, it would be best to reform our government around that goal. \n *Unlocks Centralized Kingdom, Centralized Republic, and Centralized Theocracy (Gives Casus Belli for direct conquest, 50% Autonomy Floor, +75% Core Creation, +30 Years of Nationalism.)"
 conquestbureau:0 "Conquest Bureaucracy"
 conquestbureau_desc:0 "Previously, our government lacked the bureaucracy required to integrate directly conquered territory into our nation in anything resembling an efficient manner. This needs to change, and with an expansion of our bureaucracy and creation of new positions, it will. "
 maizecircus:0 "Maize and Circuses"
 maizecircus_desc:0 "Directly conquering land and replacing the local leaders instead of using a tribute system is not the way things are traditionally done. While our own people certainly understand that we are leading the way into the future, the savages we conquer definitely don’t. A bit of positive reinforcement might help us see eye to eye. "
 removesubversive:0 "Subversive Removal"
 removesubversive_desc:0 "Even with generous treatment of our conquered peoples, there are still those who long for the old days when they were independent. These trouble persons must be dealt with wherever they are found."
 provministers:0 "Provincial Ministers"
 provministers_desc:0 " Appointing experienced leaders as provincial ministers will help us lock down control over our new territory faster than ever before."
 subtleoccupation:0 "Subtle Occupation"
 subtleoccupation_desc:0 "We don’t necessarily need to constantly remind people that we control nearly every facet of their lives. In fact, it would be a good idea to not do that and instead allow conquered peoples to mostly live life the way it was before we took them over, except of course when it comes time to pay the ‘privilege to participate in our empire tax’ and ‘privilege to fight for our empire’ tax. "
 ruleoflaw:0 "Rule of Law"
 ruleoflaw_desc:0 "A centralized government, when organized correctly, has a major advantage over the classic tribute systems: stability and rule of law. Our political system is far less fragile and it is easier to enforce a uniform code of laws throughout our territories."

 centraltribute_ideas_bonus:0 "Full Centralized Tribute System"
 formalreqs:0 "Formalized Requirements"
 formalreqs_desc:0 "Normally, our vassals send us tribute that they decide upon, and we may occasionally call on them for more. The problem with this system is that vassals may send us far less than they can truly give. We need to create a list of tribute requirements so our vassals know exactly what to send us. \n\n *Tribute Payments will be more beneficial."
 tributeministers:0 "Tribute Ministers"
 tributeministers_desc:0 "Appointing a tribute minister to oversee the tributaries in a certain sector of our empire will help ensure their good behavior and timely payments. \n\n *Vassals will be less likely to refuse to send tribute."
 tributemanpower:0 "Tribute Manpower"
 tributemanpower_desc:0 "We certainly have a lot of people, but the manpower pools of our subjects provide plenty of untapped potential. Creating a system to extract men from them when necessary would go a long way towards securing their long term integration. \n\n *May take the 'Extract Manpower from Subjects' Decision."
 expandambassador1:0 "Expanded Ambassador Corps"
 expandambassador1_desc:0 "More subjects means more diplomats required to keep them all in check."

 lawcode:0 "Law Code"

 closefriends:0 "Close Friends"

 biggerstick:0 "Bigger Stick"

 moresupplyob:0 "Extended Supply Obligations"
 moresupplyob_desc:0 "Forcing our tributaries to provide supplies and equipment for our armies is not only fun, but also quite helpful when campaigning. Connecting their supply networks to our armies ensures that our men are always fed and have sufficient equipment."
 tradehegemon:0 "Trade Hegemon"
 tradehegemon_desc:0 "Controlling land isn’t enough for us, not by a long shot. We need to control trade too. State sponsored merchant companies can help us ensure that we are the number one trade power all the time."
 gloriousleader:0 "Glorious Leader"
 gloriousleader_desc:0 "The keystone of our hegemonic empire is our glorious leader. Elevating him even further above the rest than was ever thought possible will make the thought of rebellion against him a crime in our eyes and will definitely have no negative consequences whatsoever."

 totalassimilation_ideas_bonus:0 "Full Total Assimilation"
 totalassim:0 "Total Assimilation"
 totalassim_desc:0 "The best way to maintain control of our territory is to fully assimilate every conquered person into our society, culture, and religion so they will think of themselves as belonging to us no matter the circumstances."
 convert1:0 "Proselytizing Order"
 convert1_desc:0 "Those who hold similar religious beliefs to us but who differ on a few key aspects are still dangerous to the stability of our state. These heretics must be brought over to our officially sanctioned religion by a new order of priests dedicated to spreading our religion and backed up by armed men."
 convert2:0 "Heathen Proselytizing"
 convert2_desc:0 "Now that we have founded an official priestly order for converting the impure to our faith, we should expand it to the conversion of those who follow totally different belief systems and are thus highly likely to try and escape our rule."
 acculturation:0 "Acculturation"
 acculturation_desc:0 "Too many cultures will spoil the empire. Our subjects must be made to be like us, and the best way to do that is to make them want to be part of our culture with lavish festivals and displays of our superior art and literature."

 ethnicresettle:0 "Ethnic Resettlement"
 ethnicresettle_desc:0 "Our cultural core would certainly be willing to help us suppress rebellion. By resettling entire villages of people of our own culture in recently conquered provinces we can immediately begin the process of assimilation and provide local resistance against rebel scum."
 fullexploit: "Full Exploitation"
 fullexploit_desc:0 "Now that we have such a high level of control over our territory, we can truly squeeze every last man and coin out of the towns and cities in it."

The generosity of our rule and the protection and wealth of our state is enough in itself to keep them loyal."
 cultureequal:0 "Cultural Equality"
 cultureequal_desc:0 " People are more likely to rebel when they feel they are being unjustly dominated and looked down upon. If we take steps towards elevating every culture in our empire to equal status, less people will feel this way and rebellion will be less likely."
 religionequal:0 "Religious Equality"
 religionequal_desc:0 "Another dangerous threat to our stability is religiously motivated rebels who want independence from oppressive rule. However, if there is no religious oppression then rebels who are truly motivated by religion will have nothing to complain about."
 ethnicaux:0 "Ethnic Auxiliaries"
 ethnicaux_desc:0 "Ethnic minorities should be integrated into our military. Creating special units for them, manned by them, and led by them will allow them to be useful on the battlefield without coming into conflict over petty differences with our main troops."
 cultureexchange:0 "Cultural Exchange"
 cultureexchange_desc:0 "The peaceful coexistence of multiple cultures and religions within our territory means that the previously segregated thinkers belonging to these groups can now exchange ideas with each other. Building a grand forum for this to happen would help to advance our society. \n\n *Unlocks 'Great Forum' Building."

 unitedidentity_desc:0 "We can counter the negative effects of diversity by creating a unique unified identity for all the groups of people we control, and promoting the idea that we are all better together."
 cosmopolitan:0 "Cosmopolitan State"

 productionministry:0 "Production Ministry"
 productionministry_desc:0 "Previously our resource production, be it maize, weapons, or anything else was relatively disorganized and not based on need in the way it could be. Founding a ministry to count out exactly how much we can produce, organize the production of vital goods, and attempt to make improvements to the system would greatly improve our productive capacity."
