 RISE_OF_THE_AZTECS: "Victory of the Triple Alliance"
 RISE_OF_THE_AZTECS_DESC: "In 1426, the long time dominators of the Valley of Mexico, the Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco, were cast into a succession crises by the death of their Tlatoani (King), Tezozomoc. Tezozomoc’s son Maxtla had usurped the throne from the legitimate heir, Tayatzin, whose claim was backed by most Tepanec tributaries, notably Tenochtitlan, the future capital of the Aztec Empire. After stealing the throne, Maxtla made the fateful mistake of assassinating the Tlatoani of Tenochtitlan, Chimalpopoca. The Tepanec War thus begun, pitting the rapidly deteriorating Tepanec Empire against three city states: Tenochtitlan, lead by newly elected Itzcoatl, Tetzcoco, lead by the resurgent Nezahualcoyotl, and Tlacopan, another Tepanec city, lead by Totoquihuatzin. After a 114 day siege, Azcapotzalco was sacked and Maxtla fled into obscurity. Tenochtitlan, Tetzcoco, and Tlacopan went on to declare their cooperation, creating what would soon become Mesoamerica’s greatest empire: the Aztec Triple Alliance."
 IRECHECUA_TZINTZUNTZANI: "Irechecua Tzintzuntzani"
 IRECHECUA_TZINTZUNTZANI_DESC: "Just as the Triple Alliance rises in the east, the great kingdom of the Purepecha rises in the west. Under the leadership of its founder, Tariacuri, the the kingdom conquered all of the major centers around Lake Patzcuaro and established itself as a major power. Around 1400, the kingdom was split between Tariacuri's three nephews, Tangaxoan, Hiripan, and Hiqugaje, but it is on the verge of reuiniting and bringing its great strength to bear under Tzintzuntzan. Meanwhile, the wealthy port city of Zacatula furthers its position as a great center of trade, and the Kingdom of Colliman expands into the far west."
 KINGDOMS_OF_THE_HIGHLANDS: "Kingdoms of the Highlands"
 KINGDOMS_OF_THE_HIGHLANDS_DESC: "In 1428, the mountainous Maya highlands were one of the most divided regions in Mesoamerica. Over a dozen petty kingdoms feud with eachother, but it is beginning to look like one may finally prevail. The K'iches of K'umarcaaj and their close allies, the Kaqchikels of Iximche, had secured control over the most populous part of the Highlands and were preparing to crush their neighbors under the leadership of the newly crowned K'iche King, Q'uik'ab."
 SHATTERING_OF_MAYAPAN: "The Fall of Kukulkan's Realm"
 SHATTERING_OF_MAYAPAN_DESC: "The League of Mayapan, a confederacy founded by the semi-mythological Kukulkan, united the Yucatan Peninsula under one banner for centuries, but by the 1400s it was in terminal decline. Internal conflict, ecological catastrophes, and a diminished capital had slowly eaten away at the Confederacy’s power, and tensions between the Xiu and Cocom dynasties now threatened to permanently end the unity it once provided and usher in a new age of petty kingdoms competing for power."

 tarascan_religion_desc: "Covers Purepecha (Tarascan) polytheism, which although similar to other mesoamerican religions placed a special emphasis on the power of the elite social class, who were believed to have obtained power or 'force' directly from their personal relationship with the creator goddess Curicaueri. This 'force' was maintained by leading a virtuous life and nobles were believed to be born with far more of it than commoners. As a result of this belief, legitimacy to rule was derived directly from religion and thus Tarascan elites made a greater effort to convert conquered peoples than other states of the era."

The Zapotec faith also differentiates itself with an impersonal and omnipotent creator deity, and an incredibly focused level of ancestor worship."

This faith shared aspects with the Zapotec faith in its reverence for the concept of ‘life force’ or for the Mixtecs ‘heart’, which was called ‘ini’. Mixtec faith differs in that the various ‘forces’ present in living things were personified in ‘images’ and concrete deities. In some Mixtec origin stories, revered ancestors were viewed as having arisen from a particular sacred river and then proceeding to create the deities and forces of the earth. This reciprocity produced a contract in which Mixtecs viewed death as a natural part of ‘feeding the earth’."

Maya religion was highly formalized during that cultures’ Classical Period (roughly 200-800 ad), and that formalization continued into the Postclassic. The faith revolves around the precise ordering of the cosmos, geography, and human lives and behaviors. The idea of ‘toj’ or ‘right’, ‘straight’ behavior is central - the following of correct rituals, forms, and etiquette in religion was embodied in this ideal. Numerous gods were present, and were highly defined in their images, personalities, and relationships with other gods and humans. Self-sacrifice and self-mutilation as a form of paying humanity’s side of the celestial contract were far more common in this faith than human sacrifice."

Agriculture and populations were expanding rapidly, powerful empires and kingdoms were on the rise, trade was becoming increasingly interconnected, artists and architects were building great works, and the a sense of common cultural and religious identity took shape amongst the elites.

 institutions1.t: "Birth of the World System"
 institutions1.d: "After the collapse of the great Toltec dynasties of Tula and Chichen Itza in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a new world order began to arise throughout Mesoamerica, heralded by upstart cities such as Mayapan, Tetzcoco, Azcapotzalco, Yucu Dzaa, Zaachila, Jakawitz, and Tenochtitlan. Population growth increased dramatically, agriculture intensified, hundreds of large and small kingdoms were founded, and a general trend of deep interconnectedness appeared. This world order had received several shocks by 1440s, with great states on the rise in the Valley of Mexico, the Patzcuaro Basin, and the Maya Highlands. This new wealth, helped along by a booming economy of long distance trade routes carrying all manners of luxuries, an increasingly powerful mercantile class, new language transcending forms of writing and iconography, and a flourishing of arts, science, and writing in cities such as Tetzcoco, Tenochtitlan, Tzintzuntzan, Cholula, and Cuilapan created a sort of Postclassic renaissance flowing out of several core zones. The Mayas of Yucatan and Cuauhtemallan did not stagnate either, becoming masters of metal, stone, and paint, profiting like never before off of rich natural resources and building bustling port cities that regularly sent ships into the Caribbean. This golden age of ideas and trade is now ready to take hold accross Cemanahuac."

 institutions3.t: "Spread of Weaponized Metallurgy"
 institutions3.d: "Although Mesoamerica had a long and rich history of metallurgy, metal weapons were never used in any significant quantity for a variety of reasons. Among these was the general belief that metal was sacred or that metal was a special material mostly used to denote social status, and the fact that metal edges were not as sharp as the far more common obsidian blades, which made them significantly less effective against the thick cotton armor often worn by Mesoamerican soldiers. However, with the introduction of european steel and iron armor, which is difficult for traditional weapons to penetrate, the production of metal weapons has slowly begun."
