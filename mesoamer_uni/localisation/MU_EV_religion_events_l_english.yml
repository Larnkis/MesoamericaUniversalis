 RLGN_PUREPECHA1.t: "Local Famine"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA1.d: "In one of our provinces, the harvest this year has not been optimal, and the people want for food. For a price, we could arrange for a large quantity of fish from the lakes to be sent to relieve the famine, which would make us heroes in the eyes of the locals and earn us favor in the eyes of the gods, especially the god Uazoricuare, the giver of food."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA1.a: "Let them eat fish!"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA1.b: "We need that money to expand the state!"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA2.t: "Wood for the Temples"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA2.d: "It has long been a tradition, even among the powerful men of our state, to go into the forest to gather firewood for the temples. This simple act shows humility and reverence for the gods, especially Curicaueri. However, times have changed and it may be unwise to have the $MONARCHTITLE$ wander into the forest alone."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA2.a: "I shall gather wood alone!"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA2.b: "I shall gather wood with a bodyguard!"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA2.c: "Send $HEIR$ to do it!"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA2.dd: "This is an outdated custom."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA3.t: "Refurbishing the Yacatas"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA3.d: "Our yacatas are the platforms upon which we commune with our gods. As the gods live and interact with humans upon mountain tops, it behooves us to construct our own mountains that the gods may find convenient locations to communicate with their most devoted followers. Unfortunately, recent upkeep on the yacatas has not been in keeping with the goals of the priesthood. They demand a major refurbishment project of the platforms - or we may experience major unfortunate signs of the displeasure of our gods."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA3.a: "Why stop at refurbishment? Construct new Yacatas!"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA3.b: "Refurbish the existing Yacatas."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA3.c: "We have more important places to spend tribute."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA4.t: "Corrupt Caracha-Capacha"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA4.d: "Reports have reached us of a provincial administrator, a Caracha-Capacha, who has been unfairly exploiting his subjects for his own personal gain. His ‘tax collectors’ are acting less like state officials and more like a group of tyrannical bandits - who extort food and valuables from the locals to fuel an extravagant lifestyle for themselves and the Caracha-Capacha. The man has been brought to $CAPITAL_CITY$ to defend himself, and has discreetly offered $MONARCH$ a share of his ‘profits’ if he is allowed to go free."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA4.a: "This man is innocent."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA4.b: "Outrageous! Execute him!"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA5.t: "Overworking of Farmers"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA5.d: "Peasants are complaining loudly about the nobles in and around our capital - apparently they have been overzealously taking advantage of the good harvests in the region, and the farmers are being painfully overworked expanding fields, sowing crops, and performing other such low duties. While it is certainly the god-given right of the nobles to command these peasants, there are some moral limits. Perhaps we should step in and put some temporary restrictions on the power of the nobility."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA5.a: "Let them rest! This is wrong."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA5.b: "They do what they do for the good of the state!"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA6.t: "Festival of Hanciuanscuaro"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA6.d: "It is time again for the ‘Imprisoning of Rebels’ ceremony. Here, in full view of the administration and priesthood, communities can reaffirm their loyalty to the state. Traditionally, this ceremony has taken place mainly in our capital - but recently, our achaecha advisors have noted that we may be able to expand the ceremony to the four corners of our nation. It would only take a small investment, but would help to show our legitimacy and devotion."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA6.a: "Expand the ceremonies."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA6.b: "They're fine as they are."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA7.t: "Xarátanga priest challenges Curicaueri!"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA7.d: "Our state tolerates a great number of gods - though recently, Curicaueri has come to clear prominence. Driven by the aggressive priesthood of Ihuatzio and the other Patzcuaro lake cities, Curicaueri’s brilliant light shines in every corner of our lands. But today, guards brought in a priest of Xarátanga, apparently having just had a public altercation with one of our state Curicaueri priests. This Xarátanga priest claims that our state has moved too far away from the gods of our past, and that Curicaueri’s light is burning away the love of the other gods."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA7.a: "This priest is a fool. Send him off in shame."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA7.b: "There is room in the land for more than one god."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA8.t: "Disrespectful Trader"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA8.d: "A terrible incident has struck. While being shown the great wooden palace of $MONARCH$, a fabulously wealthy foreign trader ‘accidentally’ managed to drop the obsidian dagger representative of Xaratanga’s form on earth! The dagger shattered, and the priesthood claims that we can expect nothing but misery from this incident. The trader, for his part, begs for his life - claiming he can bring a great deal of wealth to the kingdom if he is allowed to survive."
 RLGN_PUREPECHA8.a: "Execute this buffon!"
 RLGN_PUREPECHA8.b: "His wealth is too important, let him live."

 #Maya - Holy Sites
 HOLY_SITE_902_DESC: "The shrine of Ix Chel on Cozumel island was the most important pilgrimage site in the Late Postclassic - after Chichen Itza - and superseded the former in its importance to young women. Ix Chel was goddess of the moon as well as of fertility and childbirth. Transportation to the shrine was partially monopolized by Chontal Maya."
 HOLY_SITE_135_DESC: "The city of Coba, with its temples and sacbeob ritual roads that stretch for miles, was active until after the close of the classic. Even in the postclassic, Coba retained ritual status, and became associated with the god Sun-Eyed Lord (K’inich Ahaw). Walking the ritual roads became a pilgrimage activity, and minor temples were constructed at the settlement into the 15th century."
 HOLY_SITE_747_DESC: "Tikal, or as it was once called, Yax Mutul, was among the most wonderous of the Classic Maya cities, and was the capital of one of the most powerful kingdoms in Mesoamerican history. Despite this, Tikal collapsed with most of the rest of the cities in the Central Lowlands as a result of ecological decimation, extreme overpopulation, and an increase in warfare, with the final Great King, Jasaw Chan K’awiil the Second, erecting the city’s last monument in 869 AD before it fell silently into the depth of time. It’s certain, however, that it was never truly forgotten by the Maya. Evidence exists that the major temples of the site were being used for small scale burials connected with the Mayapan cultural era - and it is likely that rituals were conducted at the ruins by locals living in nearby hamlets in a similar way that they are to this very day. "
 HOLY_SITE_141_DESC: "The Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza was brought to prominence first by the hypothesized Toltec rulers of that city, and later perpetuated and even expanded as a pilgrimage site by the Itza clan when they came to power. The Itza utilized and enhanced the site’s religious prominence as a method of gaining authority and prestige among the competing kuchkabals of the day."
 HOLY_SITE_77_DESC: "Cacaxtla, a mostly abandoned city within the realm of Cholula, is the furthest extent of major Maya cultural, financial, and religious influence in the Mexican heartland. Run as a trade center by Mexicanized Maya (likely Chontal Putun transplants)  to control trade routes recently abandoned with the fall of Teotihuacan during the Late Classic, the city was thoroughly Mayanized. The greatest example of this is the Temple of the Carrying-Frame, where the classical Maya merchant god God Ek' Chuwah is shown carrying his rich goods on the eponymous carrying-frame and guarding over the merchant nobility who controlled the city.
