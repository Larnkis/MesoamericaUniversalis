 #--INVASION
 INV_main1.t: "Arrival at Potonchan"
 INV_main1.d: "Recently, many towering boats were spotted off the coast of the thriving coastal city of Potonchan, and a few days later a large group of pale men wielding strange weapons disembarked and began to explore the surrounding countryside. The local leaders mustered a force to investigate and fought several inconclusive skirmishes with the intruders, who later returned in larger numbers, with many strange weapons, including a barrel supposedly capable of splitting mountains, and their intent was clear - to make war. \nA large force was mobilized in defense of the cities, and eventually the two groups met each other and fought a fearsome battle. The local forces seemed to be prevailing until another group of the pale men ambushed them atop their alien deer-like steeds, which were later discovered to be called horses, and scattered the defending army. \nDefeated, the local leaders established peace with the intruders and gave them many gifts, including an enslaved noblewoman named Ce Malinalli, who the intruders have named ‘Malinche’. The strange new men then left for the land called Mexico where they were told that much gold and other riches were to be found."
 INV_main1.a: "Disturbing..."
 INV_main2.t: "Disturbing Rumors from Potonchan"
 INV_main2.d: "A single commoner has arrived in our lands, apparently from the Chontal city of Potonchan. He claims that very pale men aboard massive ships, which he likened to ‘floating mountains’ arrived at his homeland several weeks ago and overcame the not-insignificant local forces after several inconclusive skirmishes, and wishes to warn us that the strangers may soon arrive in our lands. Apparently they are seeking riches, and are in possession of fearsome and unknown weapons."
 INV_main2.a: "What could this mean?"
 INV_main3.t: "Arrival at Cempoala"
 INV_main3.d: "Strange pale men - riding ‘deer without horns’, wearing full suits of iron, and led by the oddly named Hernan Cortes - have recently arrived at one of the crown jewels of the Totonac people, the city of Cempoala. This man, Cortes, claims that he is the servant of a great Emperor from across the sea, and has taken the liberty of explaining to us his religion - which he claims to be more correct than ours. He has also spoken with extreme negativity of many of our traditional religious practices - and wants us to renounce our ways and agree to be vassals of his lord from across the sea. \nHe and his men are heavily armed, and it is probable that if we refuse their request conflict will break out."
 INV_main3.a: "Who does this man think he is? He will die!"
 INV_main3.b: "He does seem to know what he's talking about."
 INV_main4.t: "Arrival at Cempoala"
 INV_main4.d: "Word has reached us that strange pale men - riding ‘deer without horns’, wearing full suits of iron, and led by the oddly named Hernan Cortes - have recently arrived at our coastal city of Cempoala. There, they are apparently spreading dissent among the locals, riling them up against our supposedly repressive regime. Many of the Totonac leaders are now turning against us. Additionally, several of our tribute collectors were imprisoned without just cause! What should be done?"
 INV_main4.a: "Prepare an expedition now! These impertinant barbarians will be crushed!"
 INV_main4.b: "Invite these strangers to our capital- where we can contain and learn more about them."
 INV_main5.t: "Dealings with Caxtillan"
 INV_main5.d: "The pale, heavily armed foreigners who arrived at Cempoala recently are heading towards the capital of $FROM$, but have stopped in our lands along the way. Apparently they have designs to conquer $FROM$ and have heard that we are $FROM$’s greatest enemy. They wish to know whether or not we would support them in a war against $FROM$ if they were to start one."
 INV_main5.a: "Of course! These men would make fine allies."
 INV_main5.b: "These men are suicidal. We shall not join them."
 INV_main6.t: "The Strangers Arrive at $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 INV_main6.d: "The foreign men who disrupted the order of Cempoala have accepted our invitation to come to our glorious capital, $CAPITAL_CITY$. Today they arrived, and were greeted by $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ at the front gates of the city. $MONARCH$ showcased the richness of his kingdom with lavish gifts, and succeeded in significantly impressing the leader of the men, Hernan Cortes, and many of his subordinates. They were escorted around the city, in awe of the great markets, temples, and the abundance of people. \nLater, the leading men met with $MONARCH$, who showed them where they would be staying in the royal palace, the treasury of the kingdom, and provided them with food and drink. \nThen, Cortes told $MONARCH$ of his Christian religion via his translator, Ce Malinalli, and also told him of his great Emperor across the sea, Charles the Fifth, and how $MONARCH$ should agree to become the tributary of this excellent and mighty man."
 INV_main6.a: "Delay any conflict by agreeing to become a vassal of Caxtillan."
 INV_main6.b: "What is this? I am no man's tributary!"
 INV_main7.t: "A Cross for our Great Temple"
 INV_main7.d: "Cortes has approached $MONARCH$ and asked him if he could erect a Christian cross on the top of our grand temple in place of our ‘idols’. Agreeing to this demand would surely signify our vassalage, but not doing so will dramatically increase tensions."
 INV_main7.a: "Allow him to construct this cross..."
 INV_main7.b: "Never! Our gods have always brought us victory, wealth, and prosperity!"
 INV_main8.t: "The $MONARCHTITLE$ Captured!"
 INV_main8.d: "Treachery! The Caxtillteca foreigners have captured our great leader $MONARCH$, and are holding him captive in the royal palace. Our leader still retains his position and much of his power but he is now subject to the whims of Hernan Cortes. The situation is becoming increasingly unstable, but there is little we can do at the present without sentencing $MONARCH$ to death, so we must wait."
 INV_main8.a: "They'll pay for this in time!"
 INV_main9.t: "Incident at Potonchan"
 INV_main9.d: "Hernan Cortes, the captor of our ruler, is apparently in trouble with his great Emperor across the sea. He has been forced to leave our capital and ruler in the hands of one of his lieutenants, Pedro de Alvarado, and has gone to face another man from his country, Panfilo de Narvaez, who was sent to punish him for some infraction and has recently landed in the Chontal city of Potonchan. Perhaps we will get lucky and these demons will destroy each other."
 INV_main9.a: "Worst of luck to him!"
 INV_main10.t: "Massacre at $CAPITAL_CITY$!"
 INV_main10.d: "What horror! The vile Captain, Pedro de Alvarado, has committed an atrocity from which we might never recover. Much of the nobility, who are still allowed free movement, were participating in a religious festival in the sacred precinct of $CAPITAL_CITY$ when the greed of Alvarado and his men got the better of them. They descended on the mostly unguarded and unarmed nobles with their iron weapons, and surrounded and massacred them by the thousands. Administrators, artists, military commanders, advisors, priests… much of our government has been completely annihilated. It will decades to replace what was lost. \nAfter the attack, the population of our capital learned of the affront, and hospitality was at its end. The barbarians attempted to force our old monarch to quell the unrest, but he was jeered at and ignored, and then killed by the Caxtillteca for his failure. Besieged in the royal palace, the intruders attempted to escape our capital by night, but were discovered, and a fierce battle ensued. The vast majority of the enemy forces were slaughtered by our relentless soldiers, but the leaders, including the returning Cortes and Alvarado, and a few of their men and allies were able to escape to the lands of their local supporters."
 INV_main10.a: "War! War! WAR!"
 INV_main11.t: "The Fall of $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 INV_main11.d: "The world is ending! Despite our best efforts, the combined forces of the pale devils, the rebels who have joined them, and the devastating new diseases have overwhelmed us! Our capital, $CAPITAL_CITY$, has fallen to these invaders. The buildings have been ravaged, the libraries have been burned, the men have been killed, the women have been raped, the children have been enslaved, and the cross of christianity has been erected atop the ruins of the great temple. This is a great blow to the entire world."
 INV_main11.a: "The darkest day..."
 INV_main12.t: "Hernan Cortes Captured!"
 INV_main12.d: "Today, the destroyer Hernan Cortes and several of his captains were captured during a skirmish between our forces and the broken remnants of those of the Caxtillteca. Determined to fight to the very last, Cortes and his most loyal men, bleeding, broken, and exhausted after years of warfare, attempted a last ditch, doomed cavalry charge against a squadron of our soldiers. Cortes did his best to die, but was unsuccessful. A soldier chopped the head off of his charging horse and sent him flying forward into the arms of another soldier, who seized the man’s heavily nicked steel sword and flung it away before bashing Cortes on the head with a mace and incapacitating him. \nThe demon Cortes wast then brought before $MONARCH$ in amidst our heavily damaged city of $CAPITAL_CITY$, and shown all that he had done to the once beautiful land. $MONARCH$ then told Cortes that he respected his prowess in battle, but it had not been enough. It was time to atone for his crimes."
 INV_main12.a: "Slowly lower him into a vat of molten gold!"
 INV_main12.b: "Sacrifice him atop the Great Temple in an ostentatious public ceremony!"
 INV_main12.c: "Crucify him on one of his own 'holy' crosses!"
 INV_main12.dd: "Force him to fight to the death on the gladiator stone!" 
 INV_main12.e: "Incinerate his body and erase him from the history books!"
 INV_main12.f: "Keep him as a pet in the royal zoo!"
 INV_main13.t: "Spanish Seize $PROVINCENAME$"
 INV_main13.d: "The Spanish invaders have suceeded in establishing control over $PROVINCENAME$."
 INV_main13.a: "We must retake it!"
 INV_main14.t: "Rebels Ally with Caxtillan!"
 INV_main14.d: "Several of our provinces, dissatisfied with our rule and perceived maltreatment, have risen up and allied themselves with the Caxtillteca in hopes of eventually reasserting their independence."
 INV_main14.a: "Curse them!"
  
 #--PLAGUES
 INV_plagues1.t: "Death Sweeps the Land"
 INV_plagues1.d: "A strange disease has begun to spread through our lands of late… \nThose affected are practically covered in painful sores. It is killing many, but primarily the weakest segments of our population. Good care causes some increase in survivability - we will likely endure as long as nothing else particularly bad happens."
 INV_plagues1.a: "Do everything you can to fight the plague."
 INV_plagues1.b: "The money is needed to prepare our defenses."
 INV_plagues2.t: "End of the Epidemic"
 INV_plagues2.d: "At last, the vile disease that afflicted us seems to have worn itself out. Hopefully it does not return."
 INV_plagues2.a: "Thank the gods!"
 INV_plagues3.t: "Disease Outbreak Beginning in $PROVINCENAME$"
 INV_plagues3.d: "One of the various new European diseases has appeared in our country and is beginning to infect the populace."
 INV_plagues3.a: "This is terrible!"
 INV_plagues4.t: "European Disease Outbreak"
 INV_plagues4.d: "The disease outbreak that recently began has started in earnest. Our people our sufferring, but we could blunt the disease's impact if we devoted a significant amount of money towards providing care for the sick."
 INV_plagues4.a: "We must do everything we can."
 INV_plagues4.b: "We cannot spare the money right now."
 INV_plagues5.t: "End of the Epidemic"
 INV_plagues5.d: "At last, the vile disease that afflicted us seems to have worn itself out. Hopefully it does not return."
 INV_plagues5.a: "Finally!"
 
 #--Alt History
 ALH_main1.t: "Men from the North Arrive in $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 ALH_main1.d: "For hundreds of years, the most courageous of our traders have braved the great deserts of the North in search of rare and exotic goods from the strange and little known people who live in and beyond them. Now, a massive caravan of men claiming to be traders has arrived in the great city of $CAPITAL_CITY$ - with some very exotic goods indeed. The men were riding beasts described by amazed onlookers as ‘deer without horns’ - and wielding finely crafted blades of bronze and iron. Apparently, they had learned of these goods several decades ago when pale men arrived in the lands to the north with them - and bore them as weapons against the traders and their people. After many years of war a peace was made and trade began between the two groups. The traders learned how to care for and ride the so-called ‘horses’, and the art of ironworking. \nSince, they had been profiting significantly by setting up large-scale trade caravans on the backs of the horses and introducing them to all manner of lands. Their coming heralds one such caravan finding a dependable and safe route through the northern deserts - and many more are promised to arrive soon. They have gifted $MONARCH$ with several thousand horses and the knowledge of how to care for the beasts, as well as piles of iron weaponry. Next time, they promise, we will have to pay. \nStill, this is surely the beginning of an interesting new age."
 ALH_main1.a: "How fantastic!"
