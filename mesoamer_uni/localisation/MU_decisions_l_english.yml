 #Formables
 restore_toltec_title: "Restore the Toltec Empire"
 restore_toltec_desc: "Centuries ago, the mighty Toltec Empire dominated all of Mesoamerica, its cultural and political influence spreading to every last corner of our world. However, famine, unrest, and barbarian invasions eventually led to the decline of this greatest of empires, with the Toltecs finally falling when their capital, Tula, was burned to the ground by barbarians. No one has achieved such power since. Now, most of the royal houses of Mesoamerica are descended from Toltec nobility, so we do have legitimate grounds to back our claim as its successor, if we can unite the areas the toltecs controlled and glorify ourselves in the eyes of others."

 restore_tepanec_azcapotzalco_desc: "The foolish usurper Maxtla ruined our great empire with his mad lust for power and then fled when he was defeated by the Triple Alliance, like the coward he was. Our capital has been sacked, and all our tributaries have declared independence. The situation is grim, but as long as the people of Azcapotzalco have resolve in their hearts, we can take back what we lost by proving our might and subjugating the treasonous Triple Alliance."
 restore_tepanec_others_title: "Restore the Tepenec Empire"
 restore_tepanec_others_desc: "The Triple Alliance recently suceeded in dismantling the centuries old Tepanec Empire and it will no doubt be soon before they come for us too. We must rally the Tepanec peoples beneath our banner and defeat the Tenochs and their allies and declare ourselves the successors to the Tepanec Empire!"
 triple_alliance_ten_title: "Dominate the Triple Alliance as Tenochtitlan"
 triple_alliance_ten_desc: "It is the destiny of the Mexica of Tenochtitlan to become the greatest of all empires, the kings of all kings, reapers of tribute from every corner of the world, builders of the greatest buildings, and warriors most feared.

 triple_alliance_tet_title: "Dominate the Triple Alliance as Tetzcoco"
 triple_alliance_tet_desc: "Tetzcoco is a large and prestigious city with a long history, known for its cultural richness.

 triple_alliance_tcp_title: "Dominate the Triple Alliance as Tlacopan"
 triple_alliance_tcp_desc: "We may be part of the Triple Alliance, but we are not equal. Our city cannot compare to Tenochtitlan and Tetzcoco, for now at least. If ever wish to become the crown city, Tlacopan must become large and beautiful, we must be respected, we must be powerful, and we must dominate the Triple Alliance."
 grand_chichimec_confederacy_title: "Form the Grand Chichimec Confederacy"
