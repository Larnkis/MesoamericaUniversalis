 m_succession1.t: "Time for a New Heir"
 m_succession1.d: "With the unfortunate death of our previous monarch, it is time to appoint a new favored successor from among the royal family."
 m_succession1.a: "Appoint the most patient one." 
 m_succession1.b: "Appoint the most insightful one." 
 m_succession1.c: "Appoint the most charismatic one."
 m_succession1.dd: "Appoint the most iron-fisted one."
 m_succession1.e: "Appoint the most capable warrior."
 m_succession2.t: "$MONARCH$ Picks a Heir Apparent"
 m_succession2.d: "Succession is currently uncertain. It would be wise to select a favored heir." 
 
 m_succession3.t: "Death of the $MONARCHTITLE$"
 m_succession3.d: "Tragedy strikes! Our $MONARCHTITLE$ has perished. In his wake, the heir apparent has temporarily taken charge of the country. Soon, the upper nobility and the male members of the royal family will convene in the capital to properly elect a new monarch." 
 m_succession3.a: "May he rest in peace."
 
 m_succession4.t: "Influence the Council"
 m_succession4.d: "The council to elect the new $MONARCHTITLE$ has now fully assembled, and is preparing to start the debate over who should become our next leader. As the favorite heir of the previous $MONARCHTITLE$, $MONARCH$, now has the opportunity to plan how he will act during the council meetings."
 m_succession4.a: "$MONARCH$ actively campaigns for election."
 m_succession4.b: "$MONARCH$ remains indifferent."
 m_succession4.c: "$MONARCH$ refuses to be considered for election."
 
 m_succession5.t: "The Council Coronates a New Ruler!"
 m_succession5.d: "The council has come to a decision: $MONARCH$ is the new $MONARCHTITLE$! May he live long and bring us prosperity and victory!"
 m_succession5.a: "A celebration is in order!"
 
 m_succession6.t: "Ruler Must Prove Worth!"
 m_succession6.d: "In a hegemonic tributary realm such as ours, the political legitimacy gained by the previous monarch does not fully transfer to the next monarch. In order for $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to fully secure his power, he must embark on a successful military campaign. This will showcase our military might, prove the strength of our ruler, and convince all our tributaries to remain loyal. If he should fail in this goal or delay too long, the consequences will be dire. \n\nDue to your hegemonic government and population of over 500,000, your ruler must win a war in the next 2 years to keep the realm in check. If you do not do this, your legitimacy will begin to drop rapidly, inspiring many a revolt. You will gain special military bonuses depending on how many captives you bring back from the war."
 m_succession6.a: "Prepare the armies!"
 
 m_succession7.t: "Strength Proven!"
 m_succession7.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has won a great victory! This proves his tenacity to our subjects." 
 m_succession7.a: "Was there ever any doubt?"
 m_succession7_a_tt1: "We took captives, but not enough to especially intimidate our tributaries. We gain no extra bonuses." 
 m_succession7_a_tt2: "We took enough captives to go beyond just intimidating our tributaries. Our prestige and legitimacy has increased!"
 m_succession7_a_tt3: "We took so many captives in this war that we have deeply intimidated our tributaries and our ruler's real and percieved military skill has increased. Our prestige and legitimacy has increased and our ruler gains 1 point of military skill!"
 
 m_succession8.t: "Signs of Weakness..."
 m_succession8.d: "We have failed to win a war within 2 years of $MONARCH$'s coronation. Our subjects have begun to interpret this as a sign of weakness..."
 m_succession8.a: "A temporary setback."
 
 m_succession9.t: "Monarch Removed!"
 m_succession9.d: "The upper nobility and the other members of the royal family are highly dissatisfied with the performance of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, who has failed to prove his military acumen for too long. Our subjects are seriously questioning whether they wish to remain under our rule. As a result, $MONARCH$ has been removed from power, and nobody is quite sure what happened to him."
 m_succession9.a: "Hopefully the next man is more competant."
