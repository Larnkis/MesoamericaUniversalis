 #Statup Event
 start1.t: "Mesoamerica Universalis"
 start1.d: "Welcome to Mesoamerica Universalis, a total overhaul mod for Europa Universalis IV. This mod aims to provide you with a realistic and historically flavorful representation of the Mesoamerican cultural region starting in 1428. As such, many gameplay systems have been changed, and new ones have been added to help simulate the specific political structures in the area. You can read more about the changes by taking the decision 'Mesoamerica Universalis Encyclopedia'. \nBefore you can begin playing, you have an important choice to make. By default, Europeans will begin to arrive in the early 1500s, bringing war and plagues with them. You can choose to keep this activated for a challenging, against the odds game where you must overcome Conquistadors and vast outbreaks of smallpox, among a variety of other problems, or disable it for a slower, more relaxing game set in an alternate history where the Americas were not discovered until the 1700s, and Europe lacked interest in overseas conquest. If you are a first time player, it is recommended that you play without invasions. \nNOTE: Please wait until mid-february for your manpower to calculate."
