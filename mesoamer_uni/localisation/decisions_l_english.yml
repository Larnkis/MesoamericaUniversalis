 #Formables
 restore_toltec_title: "Restore the Toltec Empire"
 restore_toltec_desc: "Centuries ago, the mighty Toltec Empire dominated all of Mesoamerica, its cultural and political influence spreading to every last corner of our world. However, famine, unrest, and barbarian invasions eventually led to the decline of this greatest of empires, with the Toltecs finally falling when their capital, Tula, was burned to the ground by barbarians. No one has achieved such power since. Now, most of the royal houses of Mesoamerica are descended from Toltec nobility, so we do have legitimate grounds to back our claim as its successor, if we can unite the areas the toltecs controlled and glorify ourselves in the eyes of others."

 restore_tepanec_others_title: "Restore the Tepenec Empire"
 restore_tepanec_others_desc: "The Triple Alliance recently suceeded in dismantling the centuries old Tepanec Empire and it will no doubt be soon before they come for us too.
