 book5.d: "Mesoamerica Universalis is not content complete by any means and we plan to release at least four major content updates in the coming months of flesh out the mod. \n\nTo report bugs, please post the best explanation of the bug you can and screenshots, if possible, in the bug reporting thread on the Steam Workshop. \n\nPlease post suggestions in the Suggestions thread on the Steam Workshop. \n\nIf you believe you can help with the development of the mod, please add the lead developer, Ballistic, on Steam and post that you are adding him in the recruiting thread. Please note that we have a very high standard for content. We are currently looking for people to fill the following positions: \n\nAdditional Researcher (Makes extensive use of primary and secondary academic sources to correct historical inaccuracies and suggest ideas for events. Bonus points if you can fluently read Spanish, but not required at all.) \n\nAdditional Programmer (Helps implement events, decisions, and new game systems. Must have significant experience with EU4 modding and personal initiative.) \n\nAdditional 2D Artist (Draw icons and interface modifications, must provide examples of previous work.) \n\n3D Artist (Create custom 3D models for new units and buildings, must provide examples of previous work.) \n\nMusician (Create custom music for the mod, must provide examples of previous work.)"

 book6.t: "Population System"
 book6.d: "MU includes a population system to replace development. In the new system, every point of development represents 1,000 people. \nAt the beginning of every year, each province has a growth or decay rate calculated for it depending on several factors. \nFactors Which Increase Growth: \n•High manpower \n•At least 1 stability \n•Certain administrative technologies \n•Farm buildings \n•High trade power \n•Staple crops or aquatic foods trade goods \nFactors Which Decrease Growth: \n•Population above the local population potential \n•Less than 0 stability \n•Low manpower \n•Repeated occupation in a war \n•War exhaustion \n\nThere is also a statistic called local population potential, which measures how populous a province can get before growth is significantly slowed. \nFactors which increase local population potential include better terrain (grasslands are better than mountains, mountains are better than desert), increased political importance (capitals are better than non-capitals, capitals of empires are better than capitals of duchies), high trade power, and more buildings."

 book7.t: "Territorial vs. Hegemonic Government"
 book7.d: "You can choose from two types of governance, both representing one of the two major ways that empires have been organized in human history. Both come with their own advantages and disadvantages. You can switch to one or the other by taking the relevant administrative idea group and enacting a decision after learning the first idea. Most countries start out as Hegemonic governments by default. \nHegemonic Government Characteristics: \n•Reduced Unrest \n•Significantly Reduced Core Cost \n•Yearly tribute from loyal provinces \n•Not dependant on communication efficiency \n•High local autonomy floor \n•Increased stability cost \n•Heavily dependant on perceived strength, prone to collapse completely if it consistently loses battles and wars. \n\nTerritorial Government Characteristics: \n•Much lower autonomy floor than hegemonic governments \n•Reduced stability cost \n•Much more durable in the face of defeats \n•No unrest reduction \n•Highly dependant on Communication Efficiency \n•Must invest heavily in infrastructure"

 book8.t: "Communication Efficiency"
 book8.d: "Every province has a communication efficiency value assigned to it on a regular basis. Communication efficiency represents how good communication between a province and a nation’s capital is. It is reduced the more provinces there are between the province in question and the capital. You can increase communication efficiency with the “Regional Capital” building."

 book9.t: "Government Stats"
 book9.d: "There are five government stats that give you buffs or debuffs depending on their level: Centralization, Legal Tradition, Meritocratic Tradition, Religious Tradition, and Militancy. Each has a policy associated with it that will slowly increase or decrease it over time. You can also change stats with estate interactions or through events and decisions. \n\n*Centralization* represents the extent to which power in a country is concentrated in the capital. \n*Legal Tradition* represents the extent to which a country is ruled by law and order instead of the whims of despots. It also represents the level of fairness in the legal system. \n*Meritocratic Tradition* represents the level of social mobility present in a country and the extent to which status is achieved through merit instead of nepotism and patrimonialism. \n*Religious Tradition* represents the extent to which religion influences society and government. \n*Militancy* represents how enthusiastic the population of a country is for conquest and offensive wars, and how militarized society in general is. It also represents the degree to which legitimacy to rule is achieved through military prowess."

 book10.t: "Historical Liberties"
 book10.d: "In order to preserve the fun of the game and the ability to represent Mesoamerica realistically in Europa Universalis IV, we, the developers, were forced to take a few ‘historical liberties’ and make certain assumptions. The most important of these are listed below. \nThe majority of province borders are educated guesses based on terrain, political geography, and settlement density. \nIt was assumed in some cases that administrative units of the Purepecha and Mexica empires represented the approximate political geography of certain regions before they were conquered by either of those empires. \nDue to the severe scarcity of dynastic information for the majority of Mesoamerican polities, most countries in the game have randomized leaders that do not represent actual historical figures, as there simply is no data available for most countries. Exceptions to this include the countries of Tenochtitlan, Tlacopan, Tetzcoco, Tlatelolco, Chalco, Mizquic, Cuitlahuac, Xochimilco, Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio, Patzcuaro, Cocom, K’iche, Zaachila, and Yutacaha (Cuilapan), whose rulers are actual historical figures. \nThe fall of the League of Mayapan is forced in the late 1420s, whereas it is likely that the League of Mayapan actually fell in the 1440s. This is done so that Yucatec Maya countries will have more interesting gameplay. \nThe cause of the Purepecha succession war is inferred to be the lack of a male heir to inherit the kingdom of Patzcuaro after Irecha Hiquingaje I died, causing a dispute between Ihuatzio and Tzintzuntzan over who should inherit the kingdom. This cannot be conclusively proven based on the available evidence and is simply one interpretation based on what is available in the Relacion de Michoacan and the La Memoria de Don Melchor Caltzin. \nEvents should not be taken as literal historical recountings of Mesoamerican history, but rather as dynamic overviews of a historical event, as many are dynamically localized with the name of a particular country’s current ruler (who may or may not have actually existed) to preserve immersion. Some small parts of events may also be fictionalized details to add color. Many events also allow for alternate history outcomes. It is advised that anyone interested in factual recountings looks at the sources section of this encyclopedia."
