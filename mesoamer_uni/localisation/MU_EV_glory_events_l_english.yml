 glory.1.t: "Tenochtitlan"
 glory.1.d: "In 1428, Tenochtitlan was on the rise. Ruled by the newly elected Iztcoatl (Obsidian Serpant), an experienced, strong leader and excellent soldier of 46 years, the Tenochs and their allies had overthrown the oppressive Tepanec Empire centered in Azcapotzalco and sacked the city. Now the greatest city in the Valley of Mexico, Tenochtitlan stands ready to forge the greatest empire Mexico has ever seen and prove themselves worthy successors to the Toltecs of yore."
 glory.1.a: "We will shake the foundations of the world!"
 
 glory.2.t: "Tlacopan"
 glory.2.d: "In 1428, Tlacopan had just emerged victorious from a two year war against it's overlord and northern neighbor, Azcapotzalco. Assisting Tlacopan in the war were the two mighty cities of Tetzcoco and Tenochtitlan, with whom Tlacopan had signed a treaty. The three cities were to support eachother in their wars and divide the spoils of victory between them. However, this sharing of loot was not equal, at least for Tlacopan. While Tenochtitlan and Tetzcoco both got 2/5 of the spoils, Tlacopan was only delegated 1/5. As a result, there are some in Tlacopan who believe that the Triple Alliance is a bad deal and a bad idea, but most, including wise Tlatoani Totoquihuatzin, believe that Tlacopan is better off in the Alliance, at least for now."
 glory.2.a: "We will prove ourselves equals, no matter which path we take."
 
 glory.3.t: "Tetzcoco"
 glory.3.d: "In 1428, Tetzcoco was on the winning side of a history-changing war between the newly founded Triple Alliance and the old Tepanec Empire. Lead by the famous Poet-King and prolific engineer Nezhaulcoyotl (Fasting-Coyote), the Tetzcocahs were in a powerful position as an equal member of the Triple Alliance with Tenochtitlan, but vunerable at home as Nezhaulcoyotl battles with the remnants of the Tepanec supporters in the Tetzcocah Nobility to consolidate control over his home city. Time will tell whether Tenochtitlan or Tetzcoco will become the dominant city in the Alliance."
 glory.3.a: "Time will tell..."
 
 glory.4.t: "Azcapotzalco"
 glory.4.d: "In 1428, Azcapotzalco had fallen far from the dominating empire it has been a mere decade before. The death of the great Huey-Tlatoani Tezozomoc and subsequent usurpation of the throne from the rightful heir Tayatzin by another son, Maxtla, resulted in mass rebellions as a result of Maxtla's cruelty and illegitimacy. The Triple Alliance, one of the rebel groups, besieged and later sacked Azcapotzalco to finish off Maxtla. The city is now a broken shadow and the Tepanec Empire is no more..."
 glory.4.a: "We will regain our glory!"
 
 glory.5.t: "Chalco"
 glory.5.d: "Chalco is the oldest and most powerful Alteptl in the entire valley of Mexico, founded in 1176 by Acxoteca fleeing the fall of Tula. Currently a relatively centralized federation of 25 smaller Altepetl headed by powerful city of Acxotlan with strong dynastic ties to the cities of Tlaxcala, Chalco sits on the most resource rich and populous part of the Valley and has stubbornly resisted all threats to independence for centuries."
 glory.5.a: "The Tepanecs couldn't conquer us, and neither will this 'Triple Alliance'!"
 
 glory.6.t: "Tzintzuntzan"
 glory.6.d: "In 1428, Tzintzuntzan, the city founded by the great lord Tariacuri Uacusecha, had grown into a kingdom encompassing lake Patzcuaro and all the lands around it, and Tzintzuntzan itself was now West Mexico's greatest urban center. Although the realm is currently weakened by internal division, it has the potential to become the greatest empire Mesoamerica has ever seen."
 glory.6.a: "We will bring unity to the Purepecha!"
 
 glory.7.t: "Cocom"
 glory.7.d: "In 1428, the Cocom dynasty nominally ruled all of Yucatan through means of the League of Mayapan, but in reality the League was on its last legs and was nearly unsalvageable. A great civil war is brewing in Yucatan, and it is unknown who, if anyone, will come out on top."
 glory.7.a: "The end is near..."
 
 glory.8.t: "K'umarcaaj"
 glory.8.d: "After founding the city of K'umarcaaj, the K'iche Mayas began to build a mightly highland kingdom, conqueringing neighboring towns and occasionally warring with the neighboring kingdom of Kaqchikel. By 1428, the K'iche had the upper hand and stood ready to unite the maya highlands under their rule."
 glory.8.a: "Glory to us!"
