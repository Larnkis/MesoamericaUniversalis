 glory.1.t: "Tenochtitlan"
 glory.1.d: "In 1428, Tenochtitlan was on the rise. Ruled by the newly elected Iztcoatl (Obsidian Serpant), an experienced, strong leader and excellent soldier of 46 years, the Tenochs and their allies had overthrown the oppressive Tepanec Empire centered in Azcapotzalco and sacked the city. Now the greatest city in the Basin of Mexico, Tenochtitlan and it's allies Tetzcoco and Tlacopan stand ready to forge the greatest empire Mexico has ever seen and prove themselves worthy successors to the Toltecs of yore."
 glory.1.a: "We will shake the foundations of the world!"
 
 glory.2.t: "Tlacopan"
 glory.2.d: "In 1428, Tlacopan had just emerged victorious from a two year war against it's overlord and northern neighbor, Azcapotzalco. Assisting Tlacopan in the war were the two mighty cities of Tetzcoco and Tenochtitlan, with whom Tlacopan had signed a treaty. The three cities were to support eachother in their wars and divide the spoils of victory between them. However, this sharing of loot was not equal, at least for Tlacopan. While Tenochtitlan and Tetzcoco both got 2/5 of the spoils, Tlacopan was only delegated 1/5. As a result, there are some in Tlacopan who believe that the Triple Alliance is a bad deal and a bad idea, but most, including wise Tlatoani Totoquihuatzin, believe that Tlacopan is better off in the Alliance, at least for now."
 glory.2.a: "We will prove ourselves equals, no matter which path we take."
 
 glory.3.t: "Tetzcoco"
 glory.3.d: "In 1428, Tetzcoco was on the winning side of a history-changing war between the newly founded Triple Alliance and the old Tepanec Empire. Lead by the famous Poet-King and prolific engineer Nezhaulcoyotl (Fasting-Coyote), the Tetzcocahs were in a powerful position as an equal member of the Triple Alliance with Tenochtitlan, but vunerable at home as Nezhaulcoyotl battles with the remnants of the Tepanec supporters in the Tetzcocah Nobility to consolidate control over his home city. Time will tell whether Tenochtitlan or Tetzcoco will become the dominant city in the Alliance."
 glory.3.a: "Greatness lies in our future..."
 
 glory.4.t: "Azcapotzalco"
 glory.4.d: "In 1428, Azcapotzalco had fallen far from the dominating empire it has been a mere decade before. The death of the great Huey-Tlatoani Tezozomoc and subsequent usurpation of the throne from the rightful heir Tayatzin by another son, Maxtla,"
