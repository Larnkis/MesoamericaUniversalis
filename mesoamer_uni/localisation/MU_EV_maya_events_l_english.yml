 #COCOM-XIU WAR
 cocomxiuwar1.t: "The Fall of Kukulkan's Realm"
 cocomxiuwar1.d: "The League of Mayapan can no longer withstand itself. Although it brought unity to the Maya people for several hundred years, it has slowly been disintegrating since the late 13th century and now most of the provinces that comprise it are hardly beholden to the whims of the capital city. To make matters worse, severe drought has struck the Yucatan of late and the provincial nobles have been angered by the ruling Cocom, Hunac, who is an exceptionally cruel person and when questioned in his seat of power, hired malicious foreign mercenaries all the way from Mexico to brutally quash unrest. The powerful Tutul Xiu Dynasty, lead by Halach Uinik Ah Xupan, has recognized the vulnerability of the situation, and thusly lead a surprise attack on Mayapan and several other cities last night, seizing them and forcing Hunac Cocom to flee to the loyal provinces in the western half of his kingdom. The power of the League has essentially been dissolved and it is likely only a matter of time before all the kingdoms of the Yucatan are independent."
 cocomxiuwar1.a: "This will be a terrible war... "
 
 cocomxiuwar2.t: "The Fall of Kukulkan's Realm"
 cocomxiuwar2.d: "The oppressive rule of Maya Ajaw Hunac Cocom appears to be at an end! Exasperated by the Cocom’s cruel behaviour towards fellow members of the League government and liberal use of mercenary armies from Mexico to quash unrest, a powerful Nobleman of the Tutul Xiu dynasty, Ah Xupan, seems to have secretly gathered an army and seized half of the Cocom’s kingdom in a well planned series of surprise attacks. Hunac has fled to the loyal eastern provinces in the Puuc hills and is organizing a military expedition to retake Mayapan and the rest of his kingdom, but the Xius have prepared extensively and will not be easily defeated. Both are too distracted to maintain the coherency of the League, so if we wish to finally escape Mayapan’s hegemony, now is the time."
 cocomxiuwar2.a: "We deserve freedom!"
 cocomxiuwar2.b: "Stay in the League and Support the Xius."
 cocomxiuwar2.c: "Stay in the League and Support the Cocoms."
 
 cocomxiuwar3.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abandons the League"
 cocomxiuwar3.d: "The traitorous lords of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have decided that they are better off independent of the League of Mayapan."
 cocomxiuwar3.a: "They will rue this day!"
 
 cocomxiuwar4.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Joins Xiu Pretenders!"
 cocomxiuwar4.d: "The foolish lords of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have decided to stand against us and join the pretender league lead by the Xius."
 cocomxiuwar4.a: "They will die with Ah Xupan!"
 
 cocomxiuwar5.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Joins Our Struggle!"
 cocomxiuwar5.d: "We have been blessed! The noble lords of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have found it in their hearts to join the new League of Mayapan, lead by us. "
 cocomxiuwar5.a: "Wonderful!"
 
 cocomxiuwar6.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Remains Loyal!"
 cocomxiuwar6.d: "At last, some good news. The dutiful lords of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have made the wise choice of remaining in the League of Mayapan."
 cocomxiuwar6.a: "If only everyone was like them."
