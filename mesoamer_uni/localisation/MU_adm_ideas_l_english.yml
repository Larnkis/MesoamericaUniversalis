 #Hegemonic Ideas
 hegemonic_ideas: "Hegemonic State"
 hegemonic_ideas_bonus: "Full Hegemonic Ideas"
 
 hegemonic_ideology: "Hegemonic Ideology"
 hegemonic_ideology_desc: "The great empires of our world have always relied on more indirect means of control to keep their subjects in check. Direct integration can be more stable, but it is also costly and difficult in rough, mountainous terrain. A hegemony is always better if we can simply maintain it. We must work towards creating an everlasting dominion, with us at the top. \nUnlocks the §GHegemonic State§! type government."
 
 grand_spectacle: "Grand Spectacle"
 grand_spectacle_desc: "One method of maintaining power without violence is spectacle. Lavish festivals and ceremonies are just as capable of reminding our subjects of who’s in charge as armies and threats. \nUnlocks Decision §GHold Grand Festival§!."
 
 material_hegemony: "Material Hegemony"
 material_hegemony_desc: "Our capital should be decorated with the fruits of conquest to showcase our power. \nUnlocks Building §GElaborate Capital§!."
 
 economic_hegemony: "Economic Hegemony"
 economic_hegemony_desc: "Most people are selfish, and if we can make participation in our economic network advantageous to them, they will be far less likely to have a problem with our dominance over them."
 
 cultural_hegemony: "Cultural Hegemony"
 cultural_hegemony_desc: "The opulent fluorescence of our conquest-engorged culture will help us keep conquered peoples quiet. If we promote our superior traditions, art, and literature throughout our lands, then in no time at all people of all subject cultures will be listening to our drum music and buying our blue robes."
 
 social_engineering: "Social Engineering"
 social_engineering_desc: "Education is wonderful for making craftsman, poets, and philosophers out of the more advantaged members of society, but it would be even more wonderful if it was used to control the common people. If we set up schools to teach the commoners the basics of history, mathematics, and living in our community, we could sneak in plenty of subliminal messages about how to be a good citizen and that the greater purpose of life is serving our dominion. \nUnlocks Building §GIndoctrination School§!."
 
 the_big_stick: "The Big Stick"
 the_big_stick_desc: "We must not forget that even with all our non-violent means of control, there will always be those who wish to seize our power for themselves and will only be cowed by violence. The threat of overwhelming military retaliation must always hang over the heads of these people."
 
 #Territorial Ideas
 territorial_ideas: "Territorial State"
 territorial_ideas_bonus: "Full Territorial Ideas"
 
 territorial_ideology: "Territorial Ideology"
 territorial_ideology_desc: "Every empire in our history has fallen into the same trap: short term gain is traded for long-term integrity. Rulers prefer to expand quickly without properly integrating populations and act surprised when a bad drought or a single military defeat sets off a chain of events that brings everything crashing down. We must break away from this flawed ideology and create a territorial empire, despite all the difficulties involved, if we wish to avoid repeating history’s mistakes. \nUnlocks the §GTerritorial State§! type government. \nYearly Centralization: §G+0.50§!"
 
 power_replacement: "Power Replacement"
 power_replacement_desc: "Local leaders are often the first ones to agitate for rebellion against the powers that be when hard times arrive. Thus, their power must be utterly annihilated along with their lives. Only proven loyal members of our society should be able to rule towns and cities."
 
 tortillas_and_circuses: "Tortillas and Circuses"
 tortillas_and_circuses_desc: "Our own people certainly understand that we are leading the way towards a brighter future for all, but the savages we conquer are often unable to look past the execution of their traditional leaders and the dominance of an unfamiliar people. If we invest into distracting them with the numerous benefits of unification, they will begin to see the bigger picture."
 
 local_garrisons: "Local Garrisons"
 local_garrisons_desc: "Unfortunately, people often need to be constantly reminded of who rules them. If we are unable to maintain a military presence in our new lands, our new subjects are likely to forget that it is us who rules over them. \nUnlocks Building §GLocal Garrison§!."
 
 administrative_centers: "Administrative Centers"
 administrative_centers_desc: "The great challenge in creating a centralized state has always been the difficulty of transportation in our world, which is full of difficult terrain and lacks any method of fast transportation beyond walking on a well maintained road. Remote lands are exceedingly difficult to control from the capital, so logically we must delegate control to regional sub-capitals that will report to the main capital. \nUnlocks Building §GRegional Capital§!."
 
 centralized_law_code: "Centralized Law Code"
 centralized_law_code_desc: "A standardized code of laws is vital to stability and structural integrity of any state. We must create one, and spread it throughout or lands. \nYearly Legal Tradition: §G+1.0§!"
 
 extensive_bureaucracy: "Extensive Bureaucracy"
 extensive_bureaucracy_desc: "While we have made great strides towards long life, our state is still overly-subject to the whims of the royal family. A poorly timed power struggle or a sub-par ruler could easily ruin everything we have worked towards. Thus, an extensive and partially autonomous bureaucracy must be created, and be given the powers necessary to run the country in the temporary absence of central control. \n§GNo Legitimacy Hit§! on Monarch Death."
 
 #Adept Coercion
 coercion_ideas: "Coercion"
 coercion_ideas_bonus: "Full Coercion Ideas"
 
 coercive_ideology: "Coercive Ideology"
 coercive_ideology_desc: "We have no time to waste with consolidation and integration when there is a world to conquer! Threats and spectacle will keep everyone in line at a low cost to our own power. We must perfect our use of these tools to maintain stability."
 
 hegemonic_delegation: "Hegemonic Delegation"
 hegemonic_delegation_desc: "An excellent method of controlling territory without sapping our own strength is to delegate it to a client state or vassal. This can be dangerous, however, as a substate of our own country provides a perfect staging ground for a major rebellion. We will make ourselves indispensable to vassals and constantly remind them that we are the senior partner."
 
 unchallengeable_might: "Unchallengeable Might"
 unchallengeable_might_desc: "It would be a mistake to only wield the powers of hegemony against our own people. They must also be fielded against foreign powers hoping to curb our influence. Our diplomats will make sure that every neighbor of ours knows that we are the regional power."
 
 regional_capitals_ac: "Regional Capitals"
 regional_capitals_ac_desc: "Selecting important subject cities as more local seats of power will help us maintain control over far-flung areas where the power of the capital is not so easily perceived. \nUnlocks Building §GRegional Capital§!."
 
 militaristic_propaganda: "Militaristic Propaganda"
 militaristic_propaganda_desc: "Since our army is so unstoppable, it would be wise to spread plenty of propaganda about how easily it crushes enemy forces, and when it does in fact do this in a real war, we must ensure that everyone knows of this glorious victory. \nYearly Militancy: §G+0.50§! \n§GDouble§! Legitimacy Gain when you win a battle. \n§RDouble§! Legitimacy loss when you lose a battle."
 
 vast_trade_hegemony: "Vast Trade Hegemony"
 vast_trade_hegemony_desc: "Economic influence over foreign states is the perfect stepping stone towards political control. Because of this we should heavily promote trading abroad and provide financial incentives for our merchants to obey any economic controls we set forth."
 
 royal_deification: "Royal Deification"
 royal_deification_desc: "The ultimate manifestation of our power is the monarch. We must transform the monarch into a symbol of our inexorable and divinely ordained march towards world domination by declaring the royal family gods. \n§RTriple§! Legitimacy loss when your monarch dies."
 
 #Gradual Centralization
 gradual_centralization_ideas: "Gradual Centralization"
 gradual_centralization_ideas_bonus: "Full Gradual Centralization"
 
 centralization_ideology: "Gradual Centralization Ideology"
 centralization_ideology_desc: "We have benefitted greatly from our hegemonic system of government, but that does not mean it is flawless. As hard as it is to admit, we will be very vulnerable if hard times come. A process of gradual centralization and integration would mix the two systems and help to fix this issue. \nYearly Centralization: §G+0.50§!"
 
 subtle_occupation: "Subtle Occupation"
 subtle_occupation_desc: "Gradual centralization does not mean marching into a city and holding the locals at spearpoint until they unquestioningly obey our every move. Instead, we will slowly and subtly integrate their political systems into ours, with such finesse that they likely won’t even notice it’s happening."
 
 regional_capitals_gc: "Regional Capitals"
 regional_capitals_gc_desc: "Selecting important subject cities as more local seats of power will help us maintain control over far-flung areas where the power of the capital is not so easily perceived. \nUnlocks Building §GRegional Capital§!."
 
 local_bureaucracies: "Local Bureaucracies"
 local_bureaucracies_desc: "Our bureaucracy needs to expand beyond the capital and into every town and city under our control so that the gradual decrease in autonomy can be accomplished."
 
 imperial_infrastructure: "Imperial Infrastructure"
 imperial_infrastructure_desc: "By using the construction of infrastructure as a ‘trap’ we can significantly increase local dependence on ourselves. When we build infrastructure in a province we will share the construction burden with the locals who will naturally come to see us as comrades and bringers of improved living conditions."
 
 diplomatic_integration: "Diplomatic Integration"
 diplomatic_integration_desc: "Our vassal states must also be integrated into the realm, as they continue to pose a threat while they maintain some sovereignty. We will make a concentrated effort towards increasing the level of control we exert over vassal states so that the locals see us as their lords and not the ruler of the vassal state."
 
 true_centralization: "True Centralization"
 true_centralization_desc: "Our government must be slowly reformed along with our country in order to accommodate the changing political situation. \nYearly Centralization: §G+1.0§!"
 
 #Diverse Integration
 diverse_integration_ideas: "Diverse Integration"
 diverse_integration_ideas_bonus: "Full Diverse Integration"
 
 diverse_integration: "Diverse Integration"
 diverse_integration_desc: "The best way to maintain control of conquered territory is to win the loyalty of our subjects with a tolerant policy towards different cultures and religions. If we can foster an ideology of tolerance and cooperation than we will be able to enjoy the artistic, technological, and philosophical fruits of multiculturalism without suffering from petty differences between subject peoples."
 
 integrated_military: "Integrated Military"
 integrated_military_desc: "An excellent first step towards cultural equality is military egalitarianism. People who fight together will eventually begin to see themselves as brothers in arms and warriors of the same cause, which will supercede other differences. We will also have a significantly increased population to recruit talented leaders from. \nYearly Meritocractic Tradition: §G+0.75§!"
 
 cultural_exchange: "Cultural Exchange"
 cultural_exchange_desc: "The peaceful coexistence of multiple cultures and religions within our territory means that the previously segregated thinkers belonging to these groups can now exchange ideas with each other. Building a grand forum for this to happen would help to advance our society. \nUnlocks Building §GGreat Forum§!"
 
 religious_egalitarianism: "Religious Egalitarianism"
 religious_egalitarianism_desc: "Oppressed religious minorities are simply the worst! They never stop wanting independence and it is incredibly difficult to break their will to fight. However, if we remove any traces oppression and let them live like any other member of society than rebels who truly are motivated by religion will have nothing to complain about."
 
 cultural_egalitarianism: "Cultural Egalitarianism"
 cultural_egalitarianism_desc: "Every single culture in our borders should be given the same legal rights and social opportunities as our core population, and also be allowed to freely participate in any traditions not explicitly harmful to the state."
 
 cosmopolitan_capital: "Cosmopolitan Capital"
 cosmopolitan_capital_desc: "Our capital should be turned into an expression of the diversity of our realm, and our government should be open to any proven loyal subject."
 
 united_identity: "United Identity"
 united_identity_desc: "It is difficult to create a united identity for our people when they are all so different, but if we can convince them of the justness of our realm’s cause, that is, to bring civilization and equality to all, they will realize how fair our realm is and rally behind this noble goal. Even newly conquered peoples will realize that they have far greater prospects under us then they ever did under their old regime and will be less likely to fight for freedom that they will already have."
 
 #Total Assimilation
 total_assimilation_ideas: "Total Assimilation"
 total_assimilation_ideas_bonus: "FULLASSIMILATION!"
 
 total_assimilation: "Total Assimilation"
 total_assimilation_desc: "Anyone who thinks that different cultures and religions can get along in the long term is a foolish idealist and likely a subversive who needs to be seperated from their head. The only way forward is total cultural assimilation, forced, if necessary, of all subjects into our own superior culture."
 
 ethnic_resettlement: "Ethnic Resettlement"
 ethnic_resettlement_desc: "Resettling villages of loyal peoples into newly conquered territory or particularly troublesome areas will assist us greatly in integrating the inferiors. \nUnlocks Building §GEthnic Village§!."
 
 religious_purity: "Religious Purity"
 religious_purity_desc: "We cannot allow heresies of our religion to exist within our borders. We must invest heavily into stamping these pockets of non-conformist thinking out!"
 
 forced_acculturation: "Forced Acculturation"
 forced_acculturation_desc: "Sometimes people simply aren’t willing to listen to us when we say ‘if you don’t adopt our culture, we will kill you and your entire family’. From now on, our propagandists will be accompanied by armed detachments to remind people that not converting is not a viable option."
 
 militant_proselytizing: "Militant Proselytizing"
 militant_proselytizing_desc: "Our priests should also be accompanied by armed guards. Anyone who fails to convert to our religion or who harbors heathen religious symbols will be impaled on the end of a spear."
 
 assimilative_ties: "Assimilative Ties"
 assimilative_ties_desc: "The elite members of society are often the first to adopt a new culture when it appears to be more prestigious or advantageous than their current one. We should exploit this to both speed up the process of culture conversion and to increase our control over newly conquered territories."
 
 superior_absolutism: "Superior Absolutism"
 superior_absolutism_desc: "The prestigious position of our culture in our society and the world can be an excellent source of state legitimacy."
