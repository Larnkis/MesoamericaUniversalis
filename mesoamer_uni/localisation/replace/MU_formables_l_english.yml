 form_triple_alliance_tenochtitlan_title: "Dominate the Triple Alliance"
 form_triple_alliance_tenochtitlan_desc: "It is the destiny of the Mexica of Tenochtitlan to become the greatest of all empires, the kings of all kings, reapers of tribute from every corner of the world, builders of the greatest buildings, and warriors most feared. If we can conquer enough cities and dominate the Triple Alliance, our destiny will become a reality."
 form_triple_alliance_texcoco_title: "Dominate the Triple Alliance"
 form_triple_alliance_texcoco_desc: "Texcoco is a large and prestigious city with a long history, known for its cultural richness. It is only fitting that this Triple Alliance of cities be ruled by us, for we are the greatest city amongst it. If we can dominate the Triple Alliance and prove our strength, Texcoco will truly become the feared and respected heart of Cemanahuac."
 form_triple_alliance_tlacopan_title: "Dominate the Triple Alliance"
 form_triple_alliance_tlacopan_desc: "We may be part of the Triple Alliance, but we are not equal. Our city cannot compare to Tenochtitlan and Texcoco, for now at least. If ever wish to become the crown city, Tlacopan must become large and beautiful, we must be respected, we must be powerful, and we must dominate the Triple Alliance."
 restore_tepanec_empire_azcapotzalco_title: "Restore Our Empire!"
 restore_tepanec_empire_azcapotzalco_desc: "The foolish usurper Maxtla ruined our great empire with his mad lust for power and then fled when he was defeated by the Triple Alliance, like the coward he was. Our capital has been sacked, and all our tributaries have declared independence. The situation is grim, but as long as the people of Azcapotzalco have resolve in their hearts, we can take back what we lost by proving our might and subjugating the treasonous Triple Alliance."
 restore_tepanec_empire_others_title: "Restore the Tepanec Empire"
 restore_tepanec_empire_others_desc: "The Triple Alliance recently suceeded in dismantling the centuries old Tepanec Empire and it will no doubt be soon before they come for us too. We must rally the Tepanec peoples beneath our banner and defeat the Tenochca and their allies and declare ourselves the successors to the Tepanec Empire!"
 restore_toltec_empire_title: "Restore the Toltec Empire"
 restore_toltec_empire_desc: "Centuries ago, the mighty Toltec Empire dominated the heart of Cemanahuac, with cultural and political influence that stretched far beyond its borders. Our stories tell of feuds between legendary rivals and invasions from the North that brought this great kingdom to its knees, and no one has achieved such power since. Several prestigious nahua royal houses claim descent from the Toltec nobility, so we could legitimate our claim as the successors of the Toltecs, if we could only unite the core area of the Toltec Empire and glorify our dynasty in the eyes of others."
 restore_league_of_mayapan_title: "Restore the League of Mayapan"
 restore_league_of_mayapan_desc: "The League of Mayapan was always flawed, and eventually disintegrated as a result of the recent civil war. If we could control all the major cities of the Yucatan Peninsula, we would be able to reform the league with a more effective government and prevent it from ever collapsing again."
 declare_the_empire_of_tzintzuntzan_title: "Declare the Empire of Tzintzuntzan"
 declare_the_empire_of_tzintzuntzan_desc: "We have fulfilled Tariacuri's dream, conquering vast swaths of the west, and we are more prestigious and powerful than any kingdom that has ever arisen in our region. It is finally time to show the people of the world that our homeland is not the backwards wasteland they have long assumed it to be, and crown $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ as an Emperor!"
