 mil_tech_cs_1_desc:0 "During the first decades of Mexica expansion, a new weapon was introduced to the Mesoamerican arsenal: the longer ‘broadsword’ version of the macuahuitl. Originally developed sometime in the Early Postclassic, possibly by the Toltec Empire, the macuahuitl was a sword-like weapon with a body of oak wood shaped like a long flat bat, with rows of rectangular obsidian blades fit into grooves on both narrow sides of the wood haft. The new version of the macuahuitl was longer, up to a meter long, compared to the half-meter early version, providing significantly more reach and cutting area."
 mil_tech_cs_2_desc:0 "Many mesoamericans had long viewed the bow and arrow as barbaric weapons only fit to be used by the Chichimecs of the northern deserts or as common tools by peasants, preferring the more civilized atlatl instead. This changed in the Postclassic as bows and arrows proved themselves deadly weapons, especially when massed and used in concentrated assaults by mobile units. The West Mexican Purepecha kingdom was especially notable for incorporating ethnic auxiliaries of skilled bowmen into their armies, which were used to great effect in their conquests and the various wars with the Mexica starting the 1470s."
 mil_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "During the reign of Mexica Emperor Motecuhzomah Ilhuicamina, formal military training was extended from just the nobility to the entire eligible male population as part of the commoner-focused Telpochcalli school’s compulsory education from ages fifteen to twenty. This ensured that the military had an enormous body of trained men to call on during the campaign season, one of the key advantages of the Mexica military."
 mil_tech_cs_4_desc:0 "As warfare increased in scale and intensity in the Late Postclassic, there was a need for more robust and permanent fortifications that had been unnecessary for centuries. Famously, the border between the Mexica Empire and the Purepecha Kingdom was heavily fortified on both sides."
 mil_tech_cs_5_desc:0 "Marching and feeding the large armies that dominated the Late Postclassic required several logistical and tactical innovations such as a more extensive road system, expansions of the porter profession, complex systems of waystations and runners, and a system of breaking armies up into smaller units that would take different paths to the destination while still maintaining contact between them."
 mil_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "Near the end of the Late Postclassic, several parts of Mesoamerica had been consolidated under the rule of expansive states, which were increasingly capable of supporting larger and larger professional military orders which formed the core of their armies."
 mil_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "Represents the ideal Mesoamerican warrior right before the Spanish invasion, equipped and trained with the cumulative experience and technology of the Late Postclassic."
