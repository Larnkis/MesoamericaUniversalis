 calpulli_system: "Calpulli Organizational System"
 calpulli_system_desc: "Nahua city states were socially subdivided into calpultin (sing., calpulli), or units of people usually related by blood who owned sections of land and owed allegiance to the Tlatoani. In the late postclassic, calpultin were used by several states as administrative units within cities and each calpulli would be responsible for the education of its residents, military training, and providing a specified number of soldiers in the event of war."
 pochteca_networks: "Pochteca Networks"
 pochteca_networks_desc: "As empires rose and the distances involved in trade increased, the merchant class gained new power and status. Often employed for spywork in addition to commerce, the pochteca created a thriving trade network across all of mesoamerica."
 nahua_engineering: "Nahua Engineering"
 nahua_engineering_desc: "The late postclassic saw the creation of great works of engineering by nahua states, such as the causeways of Tenochtitlan, Nezahualcoyotl’s Dike, the canal systems around Lake Texcoco, and the forts of Tlaxcala."
 poets_philosophers: "Poets and Philosophers"
 poets_philosophers_desc: "The nahuas were prolific poets and able philosophers, and often mixed the two. Known as 'tlamatinime' (Wise Men), these philosophers often participated in the calmecac school system, teaching those of noble birth in the arts of the mind."
 military_orders: "Military Orders"
 military_orders_desc: "Military orders composed of landowning nobles trained extensively in combat were prevalent in mesoamerica, especially among the nahuas. In the late postclassic these orders grew to compose a significant portion of military forces and were the primary avenue for social advancement."
 altepetl_diplomacy: "Altepetl Diplomacy"
 altepetl_diplomacy_desc: "The vast numbers of city states found in nahua areas resulted in extremely fluid diplomacy, with alliances changing constantly and coercion being used to its maximal extent."
 great_cultural_legacy: "Great Cultural Legacy"
 great_cultural_legacy_desc: "The nahuas saw themselves as the preservers of the long cultural tradition of central mexico, especially that of Tula and Teotihuacan. These two great abandoned cities were a constant reminder to those who came before and rulers often made pilgrimages to them and would connect themselves to their legacy in any way possible to maintain their own legitimacy to rule."
 
 #West Mexican#
 westmexican_ideas: "West Mexican Ideas"
 westmexican_ideas_start: "West Mexican Traditions"
 westmexican_ideas_bonus: "West Mexican Ambitions"
 metal_tradition: "Metallurgical Tradition"
 metal_tradition_desc: "West Mexico was the birthplace of mesoamerican metallurgy, heir to an ancient tradition of alloy-making and bronze smithing for decorative and utilitarian purposes."
 multicultural_states: "Multicultural States"
 multicultural_states_desc: "West Mexico was home to a vast swath of different cultures, and any state that hoped to maintain any amount of control over new territory had to embrace this diversity."
 defensive_engineering: "Defensive Engineering"
 defensive_engineering_desc: "Cities and towns in West Mexico were the most heavily fortified in all of mesoamerica, owing to the defensible terrain and relatively constant warfare."
 westmexican_trade: "West Mexican Trade"
 westmexican_trade_desc: "West Mexico was rich in precious goods such as tin, malachite, turquoise, and specular iron, and trade in the region was perhaps the longest distance trade in all of mesoamerica, with merchants sometimes selling goods from as far north as New Mexico."
 confederation_building: "Confederation Building"
 confederation_building_desc: "Extensive alliance networks that slowly transformed into quasi-confederations were common in West Mexico as a response to the territorial expansion of other states and formed the basis for many of the states that developed near the end of the late postclassic."
 metal_weapons: "Metal Weapons"
 metal_weapons_desc: "Our extensive experience with metallurgy could allow us to concoct new alloys for use in weapons. Such weapons would give us a distinct advantage against any intruders on our lands… \n§G+1.0 Monthly Bonus§! towards embracing the Weaponized Metallurgy institution when it becomes available.."
 cultural_resilience: "Cultural Resilience"
 cultural_resilience_desc: "Cultures in our area are notoriously difficult to subdue, and even more difficult to assimilate, especially for outsiders."
 
 #Putun Chontal#
 putun_chontal_ideas: "Putun Chontal Ideas"
 putun_chontal_ideas_start: "Putun Chontal Traditions"
 putun_chontal_ideas_bonus: "Putun Chontal Ambitions"
 linear_villages: "Linear Villages"
 linear_villages_desc: "Our cities and towns are settled where we have best access to our livelihood - along the rivers. With our settlements so close all along the water, our people can always mingle, trade, and celebrate as one people."
 wetlands_adaptability: "Wetlands Adaptability"
 wetlands_adaptability_desc: "The landscape of our home is always moving, always changing. We must always be ready for the rivers to flood or change course. This flexibility spills into other parts of our lives, ensuring we are always ready for a changing world."
 land_of_kakaw: "Land of Kakaw"
 land_of_kakaw_desc: "Kakaw-Chocolate is king in this world. It is valued from slave to lord, and in all five directions. Fortunately for us, the kakaw tree grows abundantly in our land, and will provide the capital for many of our ventures."
 people_of_many_tongues: "People of Many Tongues"
 people_of_many_tongues_desc: "In our capacity as traders and middlemen, we are always called upon to speak as a bridge between the burnt-skinned people of the west, and our less clever brethren to the east. So long as we maintain our mastery of language, our position will always be secure."
 great_canoes: "Great Canoes"
 great_canoes_desc: "To imagine a life without our boats would be impossible. Our great canoes ply the water from one edge of the civilized world to the other. No people can match ours in shipbuilding, navigation, or seamanship."
 dynastic_adventurers: "Dynastic Adventurers"
 dynastic_adventurers_desc: "With our connections across the civilized world - and even into the barbarous world of the west, we have eyes and ears everywhere. We will always know when a regime is shaky, or when a kingdom is ripe for the taking. As businessmen, it would be wrong to refuse such a  bargain."
 vested_interests: "Vested Interests"
 vested_interests_desc: "Sometimes we must flex our muscles to maintain our position and relations with other states. Fortunately, there will always be warriors ready to exercise our influence… for the right cost."
 
 #Huaxyacac#
 huaxyacac_ideas: "Huaxyacac Ideas"
 huaxyacac_ideas_start: "Huaxyacac Traditions"
 huaxyacac_ideas_bonus: "Huaxyacac Ambitions"
 the_cloud_people: "The Cloud People"
 the_cloud_people_desc: "Unlike the unwashed saminuu nahua barbarians, our people have always occupied the high mountains of this land. Whether they descended from the clouds or were created at the river of Yutatnoho, our ancestors are tied to the land. We carry on their tradition proudly: to feed the earth as it feeds us, to live in the heat-force of the great living world around us."
 scribes_of_the_valleys: "Scribes of the Valleys"
 scribes_of_the_valleys_desc: "Our people have long painted their words on paper and on stone, stretching back since before the memory of the oldest traditions. Although in this day and age the nahuas to our north or the maya to our east may claim to have invented the art, we know the truth: book-painting has always been an art of our valleys. This art continues to give us the unparalleled ability to record our dynastic histories and traditions that we may learn from them. "
 lama_bordo_terracing: "Lama Bordo Terracing"
 lama_bordo_terracing_desc: "It will never be said that our mountain plains and valleys are ideal for growing the food we need to survive and thrive. A lack of reliable water, poor soils, and frost all put our crops at risk, but through the building of terraces of fertile clay - in combination with dams and irrigation - we can create land that is productive enough to produce a significant surplus. \nGlobal Population Growth: §G+0.0025%§!"
 highland_alliance_networks: "Highland Alliance Networks"
 highland_alliance_networks_desc: "Since time immemorial, our highland and coastal kingdoms have relied on marriage alliances to keep the balance of power. In fact, there is such a degree of intermarriage among our peoples - Zapotec, Mixtec, Chatino - that our nobility have more in common with each other in dress, customs, and culture than any other group of cultures. This affords us a great deal of leeway when making alliances and deciding the most advantageous position for our dynasty."
 land_of_fortresses: "Land of Fortresses"
 land_of_fortresses_desc: "With the number of small kingdoms in our mountain home, warfare is inevitable. For this reason - and for protection against the foreigners jealous of our wealthy land, fortifications can be found on nearly every hilltop and mountainside. Wherever our enemies come from, we will hold out and fight back."
 proven_lineages: "Proven Lineages"
 proven_lineages_desc: "Lineage and kinship is of great importance to our society. Your ancestors, and the dynastic strength of your ancestors, determines much of your place in this world. It is of great necessity then, that we record dynastic histories in word and on paper to be able to establish true dynastic links and successions - and it’s helpful for maintaining our elite’s right to rule over the common folk, too."
 border_markets: "Border Markets"
 border_markets_desc: "Although the main exports of the highlands of our land are agricultural and mineral, many luxuries reach us from the southern coast - pearls, cotton, cacao, feathers, shells, and a unique purple dye from a snail. It’s important that these goods be traded freely throughout the realm, and the establishment of border markets between each of the small kingdoms in the land - and between us and our neighbors to the north - allows us to facilitate and profit from that trade."
 
 #Lowland Maya#
 lowland_maya_ideas: "Lowland Maya Ideas"
 lowland_maya_ideas_start: "Lowland Maya Traditions"
 lowland_maya_ideas_bonus: "Lowland Maya Ambitions"
 the_land_of_plenty: "The Land of Plenty"
 the_land_of_plenty_desc: "Our peninsula of Ulu’umil Kutz has all the necessities and luxuries one could desire, from the honey and cotton of the fields, to the copal and cacao of the forests, to the shells and salts of the sea. Rather than seek out wealth elsewhere, let the wealth of the world come to us."
 legacy_of_mayapan: "Legacy of Mayapan"
 legacy_of_mayapan_desc: "The vile Cocom Itza foreigners, they with no mothers or fathers, have finally had their illegitimate league shattered. Now we may return to the old ways before this false unity was imposed upon us: kuchkabal against kuchkabal, province against province. For our honor and our lineage, let the drums and flutes of war play once more! We will test ourselves, and perhaps one day, another kuchkabal will prove itself worthy to rule all the peoples of Ulu’umil Kutz."
 cenotes_of_the_forest: "Cenotes of the Forest"
 cenotes_of_the_forest_desc: "Water can be scarce, even in a rain forest. Our land has very few natural rivers or lakes, and it is very possible for a foreigner to die of thirst while traveling through the maze of unending trees. But we know of the ts’onots, the maws in the earth in which can be found water. They are both a focus for our secular and religious community, providing water for our citizens and places to commune with the gods."
 they_of_the_brush: "They of the Brush"
 they_of_the_brush_desc: "Books of astrology, astronomy, divination, history and the sciences; this is the realm of the Ah Tz’ib of a community. They are an invaluable resource in our communities, capable both of reading and writing the complex script of our forefathers. We are looked upon with admiration by lesser peoples for our knowledge of the past and future, and promoting such men will help us continue to maintain our status as great keepers and makers of knowledge."
 patrillineal_alliances: "Patrillineal Alliances"
 patrillineal_alliances_desc: "Any given person’s place in our society is heavily delineated by their ch’ibal, or patrilineage. There are hundreds of such lineages, and the more well known and great their ancestry, the better. These lineages cut across political boundaries, and we are required to help those of our own lineages from other kuchkabals. This helps us to build ties with other states, and even to absorb new citizens and warriors from other states when our lineage is threatened."
 house_of_warriors: "House of Warriors"
 house_of_warriors_desc: "Life is warfare - war over boundaries, over lineages, and war over goods all greatly affect our society and politics. We must always have holkanob soldiers ready to assault or defend. That is why until a certain age all boys and young men live apart in a separate house in our society, learning the arts of war: painting the skin black, setting traps, fighting in the heavy cotton cuirass or tapir armor. They learn camaraderie, and the skills of dart, spear, and bow."
 uinik_and_batab: "Uinik and Batab"
 uinik_and_batab_desc: "On every level, our society is administered efficiently. There are a number of states, of course, ruled by a Halach Uinik who exacts tribute from the towns of their kingdom and governs the whole. Below him, each town is administered first by a batab governor, then by a deputy, then by a council of governors. In wartime, matters are controlled by the nakom captain. Each town is also divided into wards - and each of these has a governor, too. This complex system of central control and delegation ensures that our state is effectively administered at all levels and all times."
 
 #Highland Maya#
 highland_maya_ideas: "Highland Maya Ideas"
 highland_maya_ideas_start: "Highland Maya Traditions"
 highland_maya_ideas_bonus: "Highland Maya Ambitions"
 men_of_tollan: "Men of Tollan"
 men_of_tollan_desc: "Since the Fathers of the Quiche arrived from the coast to our highland valleys, legitimacy has been based on the descent and approval from our Toltec ancestors. True righteousness in a Toltec ruler is gained in battle, and in stretching his domain across the highlands."
 tinamit_and_chinamit: "Tinamit and Chinamit"
 tinamit_and_chinamit_desc: "The tinamit cities of today are a far cry from the villages of our ancestors, and our administration has had to grow to match. Combining the powerful lineage clan offices with geographic divisions in the city and countryside, we can arrive at an unparalleled level of control and collection of resources."
 mobilized_bureaucracy: "Mobilized Bureaucracy"
 mobilized_bureaucracy_desc: "Not only are our lineage and caste bureaucracies capable of managing our kingdoms, they are capable (and expected) to defend them. The vast majority of our administrators will take up arms in war, and strength and valor in battle is something which can even cause lineages to rise above another in the pecking order."
 lords_and_vassals: "Lords and Vassals"
 lords_and_vassals_desc: "Each person has a distinct place in our society created by the crossing of their lineage with their caste. The castes of noble, vassal, and slave (as well as the growing and troublesome serfs) allow us to maintain strict control on our society, economy, and products. It helps that the nobility is always willing to grow their castes’ ranks by creating a new minor lineage and increasing their own prestige..."
 little_brothers: "Little Brothers"
 little_brothers_desc: "Whether originally Quiche or not, the peoples of our highlands are by now strongly interrelated and tied by bonds of blood and faith. Even bitter enemies agree on paying homage to the shrines and illustrious ancestors of each other. This helps drastically in our ability to control the states which come under our control as vassals; our common bonds and mutual ritual relations make the relationship like that of older and younger siblings, rather than master and slave."
 mountains_and_plains: "Mountains and Plains"
 mountains_and_plains_desc: "From the rich coasts to the high plains, our land is one which can be harsh, but bountiful. Our people must make use of every inch of flat and arable land to match the productivity of some of our lowland neighbors, not to mention the less productive hills. This has encouraged our people to take advantage of every resource, and cooperate and organize to produce as much as possible."
 toltec_builders: "Toltec Builders"
 toltec_builders_desc: "The word ‘Toltec’ does not only refer to the illustrious Quiche ancestors, but also to the art of craftsmanship itself. Authority as a true ruler derives not only from battle, but also on the construction of a glorious capital. The building of great temples, ball courts, palaces, courtyards… all these things are the works of a true Toltec king."
