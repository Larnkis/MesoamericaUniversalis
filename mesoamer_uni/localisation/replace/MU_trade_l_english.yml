 ##Normal Trade Goods##
 staple_crops: "Staple Crops"
 staple_cropsDESC: "Mesoamerica’s primary staple was maize, but several other widely consumed secondary crops such as beans, chile peppers, tomatoes, and squashes gave Mesoamericans an exceptionally nutritious diet. These crops would later go on to become essential staples all over the world after the Columbian Exchange."
 aquatic_foods: "Aquatic Foods"
 aquatic_foodsDESC: "Several freshwater and saltwater food sources were exploited in Mesoamerica, including fish, frogs, salamanders, water insects and their eggs, and types of waterfowl. Such practices were especially common near the large lakes of the region, where aquatic foods provided most of the animal protein in the average person’s diet. The Purepecha around Lake Patzcuaro are especially notable for this practice, which they continue to this day. Indeed, the Nahuas referred to the Purepecha Kingdom as Michoacan, or “Place of the Fishermen”."
 fruits: "Fruits"
 fruitsDESC: "Fruit was another important component of Mesoamerican nutrition. Widely consumed fruits included avocado, papaya, and prickly pear. Avocado was used to make the original form of guacamole, ahuacamolli, enjoyed throughout the Americas today."
 cacao: "Cacao"
 cacaoDESC: "Cacao beans were originally cultivated in Mesoamerica, and by the Late Postclassic had acquired two primary uses. The first was as one type of standardized currency that could be used in almost all markets from Tlatelolco to the Yucatan. About 6,000 beans were sufficient to support a commoner for a year. The second use was in the making of a luxury beverage similar to hot chocolate, commonly consumed by those who could afford it for pleasure or ritual. Although the drink was usually bitter, there are records of it being sweetened with honey."
 honey: "Honey"
 honeyDESC: "Honey was a widely consumed sweet, sometimes used to reduce the bitterness of chocolate drinks. The most prominent source of honey was the Yucatan Peninsula."
 salt: "Salt"
 saltDESC: "Salt’s status as a human necessity ensured that it was always an important trade good. The finest salt in Mesoamerica came from the exceptionally rich salt beds of Northern Yucatan, which made the Maya kingdoms there extremely wealthy. The economic value of these beds lead to frequent wars over their control."
 maguey: "Maguey"
 magueyDESC: "Maguey, which is similar looking to aloe vera but biologically unrelated, is a large flowering plant that had two primary uses in Mesoamerica. The first was the creation of fibers from its leaves, which could be used to make rope and the rough cloth that most commoners wore as clothing. The second was in producing the sap which is fermented to make Mesoamerica’s primary alcoholic drink, pulque."
 cotton: "Cotton"
 cottonDESC: "Cotton was the most valuable textile material in Mesoamerica, used for a myriad of purposes, such as making the fine clothes worn by nobles, making quachtli, a plain white cloak of standardized size which was used as currency, and making cotton armor, the most effective type of armor utilized in Mesoamerica. Called “ichcahuipilli” in Nahuatl, cotton armor consisted of layer after layer of cotton sewn onto a leather backing. Some suits could reach two fingers of thickness, and were sufficient for completely mitigating or at least dampening most weapons, including steel swords. Such armor was only worn by high status warriors, such as members of certain warrior societies and higher nobles."
 plumes: "Plumes"
 plumesDESC: "Brilliant tropical feathers were one of the most important products of the lowland regions, utilized by featherworkers to make several luxury products such as fans, capes, personal ornaments, and some headdresses. The most valuable feathers came from the revered Quetzal bird, often alluded to in Nahuatl poetry as a metaphor for the height of beauty."
 copal: "Copal"
 copalDESC: "Dried resin from the copal tree was used to make the most valuable types of ritual incense in Mesoamerica."
 copper: "Copper"
 copperDESC: "Copperworking was the earliest expression of metallurgy in Mesoamerica, dating back to the 600s AD, when the metallurgy is theorized to have been brought to Mesoamerica by andean balsa raft traders from what is now Ecuador seeking the shell of the spondylus oyster along the coasts of West Mexico. Originally limited to West Mexico, metalworking had spread to the rest of Mesoamerica by the late postclassic, with metallurgists present from Tzintzuntzan to Tenochtitlan to Lamanai in modern day Belize. Several new alloys had also been developed by the late postclassic, including arsenic-bronze and tin-bronze, both of which are principally composed of copper. Tin-bronze, of which westerners are most familiar, could only be produced in very limited quantities due to the absence of a major source of tin in Mesoamerica - the closest large source was in the sparsely inhabited deserts of Zacatecas. Copper was used to make sought after luxury items such as bronze bells and lip plugs, as well as more utilitarian tools like tweezers, awls, and axes, particularly axe-monies, another type of standardized currency."
 gold: "Gold"
 goldDESC: "Mesoamerica is perhaps most famous for its wealth of gold, which it did possess, although not on the scale dreamy conquistadors might have imagined. Gold was exclusively an ornamental metal used to make jewelry and ornaments, with the most notable artisans working in large central mexican cities such as Cholula and Tenochtitlan or in service of the Mixtec and Zapotec nobility of Oaxaca."
 silver: "Silver"
 silverDESC: "Silver jewelry was relatively valuable in Mesoamerica, and the metal was known for being used by West Mexican smiths to make a special decorative copper-silver alloy."
 obsidian: "Obsidian" 
 obsidianDESC: "Obsidian, a volcanic rock that could be honed to a dangerously sharp edge, was one of the oldest key commodities in Mesoamerica, and was used to make a variety of useful tools and deadly weapons. The postclassic is notable for the development of the macuahuitl, a sword like weapon with legendary cutting power, from earlier long-bladed spears. The macuahuitl consisted of a piece of oak wood shaped like a flat bat, with grooves along both thin sides where a row of rectangular obsidian blades would be deeply set and glued in. The weapon was deadly not just for its exceptional cutting edge, but also for the brittle nature of the obsidian blades, which could shatter on contact with bone and coat the wound in tiny obsidian shrapnel, making the wound significantly harder to heal and highly prone to infection."
 precious_stones: "Precious Stones"
 precious_stonesDESC: "Mesoamerica was home to a variety of precious stones, including jade, amethyst, moonstone, and opal, all of which were used to make beautiful jewelry. The postclassic also saw the introduction of a new gemstone, turquoise, imported from the American Southwest through a trade network running down the western coast of Mexico, through the Purepecha realm, and into Central Mexico and beyond. Turquoise was rapidly put to use in mosaics, jewelry, and in making the turquoise encrusted diadems used as crowns by Central Mexican rulers."
 lime: "Lime"
 limeDESC: "Limestone’s uses in Mesoamerica were wide-ranging and included the use of limestone blocks as a building material, the use of lime plaster to face buildings and streets, and finally in a process called nixtamalization, in which maize is soaked in limewater before being washed and shucked. Nixtamalization had several benefits, as it removes toxic fungi, improves the taste of maize, and also increases nutritional value."
 wood: "Wood"
 woodDESC: "Trees are common in Mesoamerica, but certain types of trees have more valuable woods than others. Among these are trees such as the Mexican White Cypress, which was valued for its fragrant smelling timber."
 rubber: "Rubber"
 rubberDESC: "Rubber is another invention originally from Mesoamerica, where it was first exploited by the Olmecs from 1200-400 BC. The rubber tree, from which the primary ingredient of rubber is tapped, was abundant in the tropical gulf coast lowlands. Rubber’s primary use was in the making of rubber balls for the Mesoamerican ballgame, a trans-cultural sport played for thousands of years by nearly every Mesoamerican culture."
 slaves: "Slaves"
 slavesDESC: "Humans have always enslaved other humans, and Mesoamericans were no exception. Slaves were most often used as household servants, but a significant number of slaves were also involved craft production, especially textiles."
 ceramics: "Ceramics"
 ceramicsDESC: "Ceramics varied wildly in value, but not in usage. Nearly all ceramic pieces were used for utilitarian functions such as food storage. However, the simplistic ceramics found in the house of commoner would be unmistakably different from the elaborate, polychrome ceramics covered in elaborate hieroglyphs and logograms found in the houses of elites."
 
 ##Special Trade Goods##
 balsas_metals: "Balsas Metals"
 balsas_metalsDESC: "The area around the Balsas River was perhaps the most metal-rich area in all of Mesoamerica, with large and bountiful mines of copper, silver, and gold. The mines also yielded salt and jade, and anyone who controlled the mines wielded massive economic power. The Mexica Empire and the Purepecha Kingdom fought over the mines several times starting the 1470s, but for the most part they remained firmly in Purepecha hands."
