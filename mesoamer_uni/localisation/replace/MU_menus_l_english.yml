 menus1.t: "Triple Alliance Influence"
 menus1.d: "Triple Alliance Influence represents the relative power of the three cities of the Triple Alliance: Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan. Reaching a value of 100 before the other two cities will allow you to dominate the alliance by decision. \nTriple Alliance Influence is gained through options in events, from high prestige (+0.10 yearly for every 10 prestige, starting at 50), and from owning provinces (+0.01 yearly per province). \nCurrently, the balance is as follows: \nTenochtitlan: [AAA.v_ta_influence.GetValue] \nTexcoco: [ACC.v_ta_influence.GetValue] \nTlacopan: [AAD.v_ta_influence.GetValue]"

 menus2.t: "Government Stats"
 menus2.d: "Government Stats are a set of four values that represent various aspects of your governing policy. Each is on a scale that goes from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the full expression of one policy and 100 the full expression of the other, with 50 being a middle approach. Neither extreme of any statistic is necessarily more advantageous than the other, and neither is the middle an optimal option by default - you will have to pick your approach based on your situation and goals. Government stats can be changed via event options, policies, and some other gameplay actions. For a full explanation of what each government stat represents and what affects it, see the encyclopedia. \n\n•Territorial vs. Hegemonic: [Root.v_terr_hege.GetValue] \n--(Change Last Year: [Root.v_terr_hege_display_c.GetValue]) \n•Local Delegation vs. Legal Centralization: [Root.v_legal_tradition.GetValue] \n--(Change Last Year: [Root.v_legal_tradition_display_c.GetValue]) \n•Social Rigidity vs. Social Mobility: [Root.v_merit_tradition.GetValue] \n--(Change Last Year: [Root.v_merit_tradition_display_c.GetValue]) \n•Terrestrial Politics vs. Spiritual Politics: [Root.v_religious_tradition.GetValue] \n--(Change Last Year: [Root.v_religious_tradition_display_c.GetValue])"
