 VICTORY_OF_THE_TRIPLE_ALLIANCE: "Victory of the Triple Alliance"
 VICTORY_OF_THE_TRIPLE_ALLIANCE_DESC: "In 1426, the long-time hegemons of the Valley of Mexico, the Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco, were cast into a succession crises by the death of their Tlatoani (King), Tezozomoc. Tezozomoc’s son Maxtla had usurped the throne from the legitimate heir, Tayauh, whose claim was backed by most Tepanec tributaries, notably Tenochtitlan, the future capital of the Aztec Empire. As the Tepanec realm festered, Maxtla made a fateful mistake had the Tlatoani of Tenochtitlan, Chimalpopoca, assassinated. The Tepanec War thus begun, pitting Maxtla’s rapidly deteriorating forces against three allied city states: Tenochtitlan, lead by newly elected Itzcoatl, Texcoco, lead by the resurgent Nezahualcoyotl, and Tlacopan, another Tepanec city, lead by Totoquihuatzin. After a 114 day siege, Azcapotzalco was sacked and Maxtla fled into obscurity. Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan then formally declared cooperation, creating what would soon become the mighty Aztec Triple Alliance."
 TARIACURIS_LEGACY: "Tariacuri's Legacy"
 TARIACURIS_LEGACY_DESC: "As the Triple Alliance rises in the Valley of  Anahuac, another great kingdom stirs in West Mexico along the shores of Lake Patzcuaro - the kingdom of the Purepecha. Its founder, Tariacuri Uanacaze, an orphan from the diminutive island of Janitzio, conquered the entire lake basin and lands beyond with a series of ingenious diplomatic maneuvers and military campaigns starting in the latter half of the 1300s. Upon Tariacuri’s death in the early 1400s, his three sons divided his kingdom between them, and made capitals of the three most powerful cities. Hiquingaje took Patzcuaro, Hiripan took Ihuatzio, and Tangaxoan took Tzintzuntzan. Although Patzcuaro was the original capital of the kingdom, Tzintzuntzan, the Place of the Hummingbirds, now looks to be the city that will reunite the kingdom and elevate it to rightful greatness."
 ASCENSION_OF_QUIKAB: "Ascension of Q'uik'ab"
 ASCENSION_OF_QUIKAB_DESC: "In 1428, the Maya Highlands were divided into several ethnically denominated kingdoms that had been warring intermittently since they were founded by conquering Toltec warlords from the Gulf Coast in the 1200s. However, this long period of division was beginning to end, starting around 1425, when the K'iche King, K’ucumatz, was killed while retaliating against the lord of C’oja, Tecum Sic’om, for killing a K'iche Princess. K’ucumatz’s son, Q’uik’ab, soon assumed the throne and vowed to avenge his father and return his bones to the homeland. This campaign would set off a series of further campaigns over the next decades in which the K'iche and their Kaqchikel allies, guided by Q’uik’ab’s military and administrative expertise, would conquer nearly every other kingdom in the Highlands and unite much of modern day Guatemala, then called Cuauhtemallan."
 FALL_OF_KUKULKANS_REALM: "Fall of Kukulkan's Realm"
 FALL_OF_KUKULKANS_REALM_DESC: "The League of Mayapan, a large confederacy founded by the Semi-Mythological Kukulkan, united much of the Yucatan Peninsula under one banner for hundreds of years, but by 1428 it was in terminal decline. Internal conflict, a diminished capital, and catastrophic famines had eaten away at the confederacy’s power, and now the heavy handed rule of Hunac Cocom has angered the prominent Xiu dynasty of Mani, which plots a coup under lord Ah Xupan Xiu. Dark days are ahead for the Yucatec Maya."
