 encyclopedia6.t: "Population System"
 encyclopedia6.d: "MU includes a population system to replace development. In the new system, every point of development represents 1,000 people. \nAt the beginning of every year, each province has a growth or decay rate calculated for it depending on several factors. \nFactors Which Increase Growth: \n•High manpower \n•At least 1 stability \n•Certain administrative technologies \n•Farm buildings \n•High trade power \n•Staple crops or aquatic foods trade goods \nFactors Which Decrease Growth: \n•Population above the local population potential \n•Less than 0 stability \n•Low manpower \n•Repeated occupation in a war \n•War exhaustion \n\nThere is also a statistic called local population potential, which measures how populous a province can get before growth is significantly slowed. \nFactors which increase local population potential include better terrain (grasslands are better than mountains, mountains are better than desert), increased political importance (capitals are better than non-capitals, capitals of empires are better than capitals of duchies), high trade power, and more buildings."

 encyclopedia7.t: "Territorial vs. Hegemonic Government"
 encyclopedia7.d: "You can choose from two types of governance, both representing one of the two major ways that empires have been organized in human history. Both come with their own advantages and disadvantages. You can switch to one or the other by taking the relevant administrative idea group and enacting a decision after learning the first idea. Most countries start out as Hegemonic governments by default. \nHegemonic Government Characteristics: \n•Reduced Unrest \n•Significantly Reduced Core Cost \n•Yearly tribute from loyal provinces \n•Not dependant on communication efficiency \n•High local autonomy floor \n•Increased stability cost \n•Heavily dependant on perceived strength, prone to collapse completely if it consistently loses battles and wars. \n\nTerritorial Government Characteristics: \n•Much lower autonomy floor than hegemonic governments \n•Reduced stability cost \n•Much more durable in the face of defeats \n•No unrest reduction \n•Highly dependant on Communication Efficiency \n•Must invest heavily in infrastructure"

 encyclopedia8.t: "Communication Efficiency"
 encyclopedia8.d: "Every province has a communication efficiency value assigned to it on a regular basis. Communication efficiency represents how good communication between a province and a nation’s capital is. It is reduced the more provinces there are between the province in question and the capital. You can increase communication efficiency with the “Regional Capital” building."

 encyclopedia9.t: "Government Stats"
 encyclopedia9.d: "There are five government stats that give you buffs or debuffs depending on their level: Centralization, Legal Tradition, Meritocratic Tradition, Religious Tradition, and Militancy. Each has a policy associated with it that will slowly increase or decrease it over time. You can change these stats through events, decisions, and buildings. \n\n*Centralization* represents the extent to which power in a country is concentrated in the capital. \n*Legal Tradition* represents the extent to which a country is ruled by law and order instead of the whims of despots. It also represents the level of fairness in the legal system. \n*Meritocratic Tradition* represents the level of social mobility present in a country and the extent to which status is achieved through merit instead of nepotism and patrimonialism. \n*Religious Tradition* represents the extent to which religion influences society and government. \n*Militancy* represents how enthusiastic the population of a country is for conquest and offensive wars, and how militarized society in general is. It also represents the degree to which legitimacy to rule is achieved through military prowess."

 encyclopedia29.t: "Government Stats, Part II"
 encyclopedia29.d: "Each of the five government statistics are measured with a number from -100 to +100.  You can see the numbers by hovering over envelope icon for the 'Check Country Statistics' decision on the 'Missions and Decisions' tab.  Each 20 point range corresponds to a different set of scaled modifiers that you can see on the 'Government' tab.\n\n*Centralization* has modifiers from 'Decentralization 5' up to 'Centralization 5'.  Lower Centralization gives benefits for Unrest, Coring Cost, Trade Efficiency and Hostile Attrition while higher Centralism reduces Autonomy and improves Trade Steering.\n\n*Legal Tradition* has modifiers from 'Weak Law 5' up to 'Strong Law 5'. Higher Legal Tradition gives benefits for Stability Cost, Admin Tech Cost, Unrest, Corruption and Autonomy.  Constructing Court System buildings in your capital can increase Legal Tradition.\n\n*Meritocratic Tradition* has modifiers from 'Patrimonialism 5' up to 'Meritocracy 5'.  Higher Meritocratic Tradition will improve Unrest, Discipline and the quality of your military leaders.\n\n*Religious Tradition* has modifiers from 'Secularism 5' to 'Spiritualism 5'.  Secularism gives a boost to religious tolerance while Spiritualism improves Legitimacy, Morale and Missionary Strength.\n\n*Militancy* has modifiers from 'Pacifism 5' up to 'Militancy 5'.  Pacificism is not a virtue as it hurts Morale and War Exhaustion.  High Militancy has the opposite effect as long as you are at war.  If you're at peace, though, your Legitimacy will take a big hit."

 encyclopedia10.t: "Historical Liberties"
 encyclopedia10.d: "In order to preserve the fun of the game and the ability to represent Mesoamerica realistically in Europa Universalis IV, we, the developers, were forced to take a few ‘historical liberties’ and make certain assumptions. The most important of these are listed below. \nThe majority of province borders are educated guesses based on terrain, political geography, and settlement density. \nIt was assumed in some cases that administrative units of the Purepecha and Mexica empires represented the approximate political geography of certain regions before they were conquered by either of those empires. \nDue to the severe scarcity of dynastic information for the majority of Mesoamerican polities, most countries in the game have randomized leaders that do not represent actual historical figures, as there simply is no data available for most countries. Exceptions to this include the countries of Tenochtitlan, Tlacopan, Tetzcoco, Tlatelolco, Chalco, Mizquic, Cuitlahuac, Xochimilco, Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio, Patzcuaro, Cocom, K’iche, Acalan-Tixchel, Tzutujal, Tepeticpac, Ocotelulco, Tizatlan, Quiahuixtlan, Zaachila, and Yutacaha (Cuilapan), whose rulers are actual historical figures. \nThe fall of the League of Mayapan is forced in the late 1420s, whereas it is likely that the League of Mayapan actually fell in the 1440s. This is done so that Yucatec Maya countries will have more interesting gameplay. \nThe cause of the Purepecha succession war is inferred to be the lack of a male heir to inherit the kingdom of Patzcuaro after Irecha Hiquingaje I died, causing a dispute between Ihuatzio and Tzintzuntzan over who should inherit the kingdom. This cannot be conclusively proven based on the available evidence and is simply one interpretation based on what is available in the Relacion de Michoacan and the La Memoria de Don Melchor Caltzin. \nThe Highland Maya ideas currently represent the K'iche ethnic group and do not necessarily represent the various other peoples of the highlands. This is due to the scarcity of information on most Highland Maya cultures. \nEvents should not be taken as literal historical recountings of Mesoamerican history, but rather as dynamic overviews of a historical event, as many are dynamically localized with the name of a particular country’s current ruler (who may or may not have actually existed) to preserve immersion. Some small parts of events may also be fictionalized details to add color. Many events also allow for alternate history outcomes. It is advised that anyone interested in factual recountings looks at the sources section of this encyclopedia."

 encyclopedia11.t: "Nahuatl Pronunciation Guide"
 encyclopedia11.d: "With all due regards to Professor Emeritus David Jordan of UC San Diego. \nNahuatl can be confusing to puzzle out for the average English speaker. The recording, spelling, and consistency of nahuatl has in general been spotty throughout its interaction with colonial spanish-speaking documentarians. Because the spelling of Nahuatl was originally based on spelling conventions in 16th-century Spanish, Nahuatl texts are generally "pronounced like Spanish," with the following exceptions and points to note: \n•Words are stressed on the second-to-the-last vowel (excluding U) regardless of final consonants. \n•X is pronounced like English SH. \n•LL is pronounced like a long L (not as in Spanish). \n•TL counts as a single consonant, never as a full syllable. It is NOT 'NA-WAH-TUL', it's 'NA-WAA-TL'. The best way to describe this sound is to combine t and l together and end that syllable, which should be spoken quickly, with your tongue touching the back of your teeth. \n•U does not occur as an independent vowel. The only Nahuatl vowels are A, E, I, and O, although each of them can be long or short. \n•CU and UC are both pronounced KW. \n•HU and UH are both pronounced W. \n•H without an adjacent U represents a "silent" glottal stop (as in go_over); in modern Nahuatl it sometimes has a sound similar to an English H and may have had that value in some dialects of Classical Nahuatl as well. (For an English speaker, pronouncing the H like an English H is not really wrong and has the advantage that it helps one remember that it is there.) \n•C before E or I is pronounced like English S. (The letter S is not used in Classical Nahuatl.) \n•Z is pronounced like English S. (The letter S is not used in Classical Nahuatl.) \nThus: \n•Tenochtitlan = te-noch-TI-tlan \n•Tlaxcala = tlash-KA-la \n•Xochimilco = sho-chi-MIL-co \n•Cuauhtémoc = kwa-wa-TEH-mok \n•Montezuma -> Motecusoma = mo-tekw-SO-mah"

 encyclopedia21.d: "This guide refers specifically to Modern Isthmus Zapotec, which was prevalent in the Postclassic in an earlier form and is still spoken by some 400,000 people today. It is mostly accurate for other Zapotec languages. \nVowels: \n•A - As a in English father \n•E - As ey in English they \n•I - As i in English machine \n•O - As ow in English slow \n•U - as oo in English boot \n•Other Vowel Rules: \n•Stressed vowels are pronounced slightly longer than any other. Example, benda (fish), e is longer than a. Stress is usually placed on the second to last syllable. \n•An apostrophe that follows a vowel indicates a shortened, or abrupt, pronunciation of such. Example: ba’du’ (boy). \n•When two identical vowels appear successively, they are pronounced as separate syllables (but counted as one) with a glottal stop in-between - like the vowel sounds in uh-oh. Example: saa (celebration). \n•Consonants: \nIsthmus Zapotec has the same consonant sounds as English except in the following cases: \n•dx - As j in English jury \n•hu - as w in English well. \n•J - Nasalizes any consonant that follows immediately. Its pronunciation when preceding a vowel is not found in English: a comparable sound can be achieved with a raspy pronunciation of h, as in English hat. \n•R - As in English radio; sometimes pronounced as Spanish rolled, or trilled r. \n•xh - As sh in English fish. \n•X - As j in French jour when immediately preceding a vowel, as sh in English fish when immediately preceding a consonant. \n•Other - Pronunciation of p, t, ch, c/qu, s, xh, m, y, and hu is elongated when the consonants are preceded immediately by a stressed syllable (lengthening after the stressed syllable is sometimes applied to n and l; as with rolled r, context is the deciding factor) Example: in bicuti’ (worm), t is long. \n\nSource: Zapotec-English English-Zapotec (Isthmus) Concise Dictionary by A.

 encyclopedia22.t: "Yucatec Maya Pronunciation Guide"
 encyclopedia22.d: "This guide refers specifically to Modern Yucatec Maya, which is spoken by around 1.2 million people today and was prevalent on the Yucatan Peninsula in an earlier form in the Postclassic. Most of the rules here will apply to other Mayan languages as well. \nGlottal Stops: \nLike the click sounds in certain African languages, the “glottal stop” poses a distinct problem for non-native speakers. In the alphabet used to write Yucatec, ‘ represents the sound made in stopping the breath which is similar to the stoppage of air in English uh-oh or in button when spoken rapidly. Pronounced simultaneously with the vowel or consonant that it accompanies, the glottal stop gives a characteristic ‘pop’ to the sound. The glottal stop is integral to meaning when applied to five consonants, (For example, kab means ‘bee’ while k’ab means “manual labor”) they are ch’, k’, p’, t’, and tz’. \nVowels: \n•A - As a in father \n•E - As a in fate \n•I - As ee in feet \n•O - As o in go \n•U - as o in who \nConsonants: \nSame consonants as English except in the following cases: \n•B - Sounds like b in bed but somewhat softer between vowels; often weak or unpronounced at the ends of words. \n•L - Weak or unpronounced at the end of a word. \n•X - Sounds like English sh. \nPitch: \n•Pitch rises towards the ends of words. \n•Vowels last or second to last rise in pitch in many words. \n•The long vowels in some words, even towards the beginning of the word, form a ‘peak’ in overall pitch."

 encyclopedia23.t: "Food-Based Stereotyping"
 encyclopedia23.d: "You can’t play even one game of EUIV without calling another country a derogatory food based name, can you? We know, we know - you come to this mod, and suddenly it’s like “Wait, do I call them all tortillas or what?” It’s hard being passively racist in this kind of environment, so we’ve prepared a handy guide for your comedic self-posting needs. When you’re fed up with the: \nAztecs - Tenochca, Acolhua, Tepaneca, they’re all the same, really. They also have a particular fondness for tlaxcaltin (tortillas) dipped in molli sauce. But this isn’t really peculiar about them in relation to other groups, and definitely not enough to make a punchline. For this reason, we recommend saying ‘Remove Chinampas’ as your go-to. \nTarascans - Tzintzuntzan is such a ridiculous sounding name anyway that it practically doesn’t need a punchline. But lucky you, because the Aztecs already prepared a couple for you! They called the Purepecha ‘Fishermen’, because they ate a lot of fish. This is where we get the name of the state Michoacan - because the nahua word for fish is ‘michin’. But you didn’t come here to learn, you came here to make a joke! The plural of ‘michin’ can be ‘mimichtin’, and we suggest that’s what you go with. ‘Remove Mimichtin’. ‘Remove Fishermen’ if you’re feeling unkind. \nTlaxcala - Yes, they’ve got really cool looking flags, but who REALLY wants to deal with the Tlaxcalteca when you’re trying to dominate the Triple Alliance? The nice thing is there’s a ready-made joke here too! You see, when the Spaniards arrived at Tlaxcala, there is reason to believe it was called Texcallan instead - Place of Stones. The Spaniards had a hard time with that, because it sounded an awful lot like the word for tortilla, tlaxcala, so they just ended up fusing the two together into Tlaxcallan accidentally. Therefore, it adds historical insult to injury to say ‘Remove Tortilla’ when dealing with Tlaxcalteca. \nOaxacans - Wait, do we still have these in the beta build? Okay, we’ll have to make a note to remove them later. Apparently, Oaxacans are a pretty rad group of folks who like catching grasshoppers and cookin’ ‘em. Today, these little hoppers are called ‘chapulines’, but the original nahuatl is ‘chapolin’. So we recommend ‘Remove Chapolin’ when dealing with Zapoteca and Mixteca. If that’s too hard for you, why are you even playing this game? \nMayans - There’s so many of them, why are there so many of them? If all these crazy mayans have one thing in common, it’s that they were not down with tortillas. We’ve found like zero flat griddles to make ‘em in their archeological sites, so that confirms 100% certainty that they never ate tortillas. I tell you what they did eat, though, was tamales. Unfortunately, the Yucatec term for tomal is ‘Wah’ or ‘Waj’ where the ‘j’ is that awful throat sound in scottish ‘loch’. So, instead, we’ll just say ‘Remove Tamales’ when talking about Mayans, unless you want to be accurate in which case you’ll say ‘Remove Waj’. Everyone else is Chichimeca."

 encyclopedia25.t: "What Happened Before Game Start? Part I"
 encyclopedia25.d: "Our game takes place during the ‘Postclassic’ period of Mesoamerican history, which is from roughly 900 CE - 1519 CE. Before that we have the ‘Classic’ or ‘Classical’ period, from roughly 200 CE - 900 CE. What was so special about the Classic? During this period we had the major rise and fall of some of the most complex, far-ranging, and sophisticated kingdoms in Mesoamerican history. \nIn the Mayan area, this was the epoch of the great city states of the Mayan lowlands. They reached the apogee of sophistication in their writing system, mathematics and sciences, political systems, and cultural achievements such as architecture. \nIn the Oaxaca area, this was the heyday of the kingdom of Monte Alban, the greatest of the Zapotec states. Stretching across the highlands of the area, Monte Alban had advanced writing and political structures, and was connected strongly into the overall West-East trading network between Mexico and the Mayan area. \nIn Central Mexico, this was the rise and fall of the greatest of the Mesoamerican cities, Teotihuacan. Teotihuacan’s influence stretched the length and breadth of the entire Mesoamerican cultural area, reaching even to the Mayan city states and up north to the Pueblo peoples of Oasisamerica. Teotihuacan had an unparalleled population concentration and metropolitan character, with individual ethnic wards containing Mayan, Zapotec, and other groups in distinct neighborhoods. The Teotihuacanos had writing (we’re increasingly aware), advanced military and religious structures, and control over vast swathes of trading networks. \nThe Fall: Between 800 CE and 1000 CE, the majority of extant major dominant political structures strongly changed. Some collapsed, such as the state of Teotihuacan and the cities of the flourishing Mayan southern lowlands. Some underwent radical demographic and political shift, such as the increasingly well-connected northern Yucatan city states. This transformation had different causes in differing areas, but a major component in several areas was unprecedented climate shift and the introduction of migrant ethnic groups, such as major bands of Nahuatl-speaking peoples in the north of the Mesoamerican cultural area."

 encyclopedia26.t: "What Happened Before Game Start? Part II"
 encyclopedia26.d: "Between 900 CE and the Start Date: The Postclassic saw creation of a great many independent and quite inventive polities. In the north, the Toltec state came to prominence. Although traditionally thought of as an ‘empire’, in truth the Toltec state had wide cultural influence but very little direct territorial control. Offshoots of the Toltec dynasty, or Toltec-inspired adventurers, founded powerful city states in places as far flung as Chichen Itza in the Yucatan. Elsewhere, Mexicanized Maya known as Putun Chontal took control (without a strong state structure, but independently) of several of the old trade networks, and gave rise to roving mercenary knightly bands who would later found dynasties in the Kiche highlands and at Mayapan. \nIn essence, at the start date of 1428, the Mesoamerican area is on the verge of further radical change. The breakdown of the old monopolies at the end of the Classic period has encouraged the rise of a mobile merchant class in several societies, and the area is connected as never before. Independent, militarized city states fight for control in several areas, and the region is about to see the rise of strong and expansive ‘empires’ again in a way it has not for a long time. These factors will lead to a kind of Postclassic renaissance that creates some of the greatest, most urbanized, and most sophisticated cultures the world has ever seen. That is, until it all comes crashing down in 1519."

 encyclopedia27.d: "We’ll take a spin around the different cultural areas of Mesoamerica and peek in at each one to see what the major state is of the various alliances and regional powers, just so you have an idea of what’s going on. \nCentral Mexico: Around Lake Texcoco, the upstart alliance of Tenochtitlan, Tlacopan, Tetzcoco, and Tlatelolco has overthrown the short-lived empire of the Tepaneca centered in Azcapotzalco. Now, the balance of power sits on a knife’s edge between these northern cities and the powerful heartlands of Xochimilco and Chalco in the south of the basin. Outside of the Valley of Mexico, in the eastern highlands, tension is high between the various states of what will one day be the Tlaxcala or Texcallan confederacy. Tizatlan and Cholula (THE major religious center of speakers of nahuatl) are chief among these. \nWestern Mexico: Although the Western part of the area has never been the home of major state empires, that is about to change. The Purepecha people (a linguistic isolate) around lake Patzcuaro are gathering in strength, and recently under their legendary ruler Tariácuri expanded drastically. Unfortunately, now Tariácuri’s domain is split between his relations, following his death. The cities of Ihuatzio, Tzintzuntzan, and Patzcuaro vie for power. Elsewhere, the valuable Balsas basin sits with a wealth of copper and other minerals waiting for a conqueror. Along the coast, the powerful trading power of Zacatula vies for control with the peoples of Colliman further up the coast. \nOaxaca Area: It has been long since Monte Alban dominated these highlands. The presence of Mixtec city states since the beginning of the Post Classic has put pressure on the Zapotec states to retain control of the limited agricultural area of the mountains. Perhaps the most powerful of the Mixtec states is rising along the coast at Yucu Dzaa, called by the nahua Tututepec. Opposing them is the major remaining Zapotec kingdom at Zaachila, who historically will soon collapse and form a new kingdom at Tehuantepec, or Guisii. \nMayan Lowlands: Until several years into the start of our game historically, the Yucatan is under the control of the unloved Cocom Itza of Mayapan. Maintaining power solely through control over the noble families of the various city states, the involuntary ‘League of Mayapan’ is about to collapse. Along the west coast and at several commercial colonies, the Putun Chontal maintain a brisk trade, profiting from everything from the rich salt beds of the northern coast to the pilgrimage at the island of Cozumel. \nMayan Highlands: The Kiche have emerged victorious. Bursting onto the scene from their start as knightly warrior bands from the Putun Chontal area, the Kiche lineages quickly managed to take control of the majority of the Mayan highlands and enforce their new Mexicanized Toltec ideas of kingship, culture, and faith. The kingdoms they dominate include Kiche proper, as well as Rabinal, Kaqchikel, and Tzutujil, among others."
