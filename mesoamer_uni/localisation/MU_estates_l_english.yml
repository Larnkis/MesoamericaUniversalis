 weakenms4.t: "Conflict Ends in Defeat!"
 weakenms4.d: "Cataclysm! The private armies of the upper merchant class have somehow managed to defeat the armies of $MONARCH$, probably through some fell alliance with the more unsavory deities. This is truly a sad day for workers everywhere."

Unlike the nobles, the Priesthood is usually incapable of raising its own armies and will be forced to simply accept the revocation of privileges, though at the cost of loyalty. But, if you command a powerful country with high Religious Tradition and the Priesthood is influential enough, the Priests will raise armies of the faithful against you and work to weaken your legitimacy as a monarch. \nThe Priests will meet your attempts to weaken them with armed resistence if your development is at least 50,000, your Religious Tradition is at least 80, their influence is at least 40, and their loyalty is less than 60.

 #Birth of an Estate
 estatebirth1.t: "Birth of the Upper Nobility"
 estatebirth1.d: "As our power grows, so does the power of our noble class. Strengthened by the steadily increasing wealth of our state and glory from military conquest, the nobles have reached a position of extreme prominence and influence in our country. While this makes them more capable of assisting us, it also signals that angering them will become an increasingly dangerous course of action."
 estatebirth1.a: "A mixed blessing."
 
 estatebirth2.t: "Birth of the Lower Nobility"
 estatebirth2.d: "Our extensive influence and lordship over dozens of noble dynasties has led to the birth of a new social class: the Lower Nobility. Above the commoners but not nearly as wealthy or powerful as the Upper Nobles, the Lower Nobles rule small cities and villages or work as professional soldiers and bureaucrats, and are generally easy for the monarch to control. Still, angering them enough could provoke a dangerous general rebellion."
 estatebirth2.a: "Great, more whiners."
 
 estatebirth3.t: "Birth of the Merchant Class"
 estatebirth3.d: "Trade has become an increasingly important part of our economy, and that combined with the less rigid social hierarchy has led to the birth of a powerful commercial class. While not of noble birth and often the object of ire and jealousy by nobles who view them as pretentious upstarts, the Merchants have begun to organize and now wield significant influence in our nation."
 estatebirth3.a: "I can already see where this is going..."
 
 estatebirth4.t: "Rebirth of the Priesthood Estate"
 estatebirth4.d: "In the past, we managed to completely break the political influence of the Priesthood in our country, but we were never able to break the religious faith of our subjects. As time passes and the past wrongs of the Priesthood are forgotten, our people increasingly look to them as more than just offerers of religious guidance, and the Priesthood has successfully restored at least some of its prior influence in our government."
 estatebirth4.a: "They better not try anything this time!"
