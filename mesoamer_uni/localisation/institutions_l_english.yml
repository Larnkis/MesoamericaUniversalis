 feudalism:0 "The Altepetl"
 desc_feudalism:0 "The Altepetl was the basic sociopolitical unit in Mesoamerica, and had existed in one form or another since the first emergence of state level societies in the ancient past. ‘Altepetl’ is a nahuatl word that translates to ‘city-state’, but it also carries several connotations beyond that as a concept, and has been called a multitude of different names by a multitude of different cultures. The Altepetl is defined by several common features: a ruling dynasty or group of dynasties who inherit power, generally spearheaded by a single king, a significant population of common people of a similar ethnicity who divide themselves into large ‘neighborhoods’ based on lineage, occupation, or both, and usually owe labor tribute to the elite class, and a high level of urbanization, with the state focused around one densely populated city with various dependent villages and hamlets. \nThe system is similar to the European historiographic concept of Feudalism in its basic organization and system of lords and vassals, with some major exceptions. Unlike Europe, land was generally collectively owned by the ‘neighborhood’, with each specific family having land rights to a piece of the land. Also, the lord of the Altepetl was almost always elected from a small pool of royals and upper nobles instead of completely direct succession. The Altepetl represented a strong and unquestionable tradition of urbanism, institutionalized government, and social stratification, and had permeated Mesoamerica for well over a thousand years by 1428."
 world_system:0 "The World System"
 desc_world_system:0 "After the collapse of the great Toltec dynasties of Tula and Chichen Itza in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a new world order began to arise throughout Mesoamerica, heralded by upstart cities such as Mayapan, Tetzcoco, Azcapotzalco, Yucu Dzaa, Zaachila, Jakawitz, and Tenochtitlan. Population growth increased dramatically, agriculture intensified, hundreds of large and small kingdoms were founded, and a general trend of deep interconnectedness appeared. This world order had received several shocks by 1440s, with great states on the rise in the Valley of Mexico, the Patzcuaro Basin, and the Maya Highlands. This new wealth, helped along by a booming economy of long distance trade routes carrying all manners of luxuries, an increasingly powerful mercantile class, new language transcending forms of writing and iconography, and a flourishing of arts, science, and writing in cities such as Tetzcoco, Tenochtitlan, Tzintzuntzan, Cholula, and Cuilapan created a sort of Postclassic renaissance flowing out of several core zones. The Mayas of Yucatan and Cuauhtemallan did not stagnate either, becoming masters of metal, stone, and paint, profiting like never before off of rich natural resources and building bustling port cities that regularly sent ships into the Caribbean. It was truly a golden age."
 weaponized_metalworking: "Weaponized Metallurgy"
 desc_weaponized_metalworking: "Although Mesoamerica had a long and rich history of metallurgy, metal weapons were never used in any significant quantity for a variety of reasons. Among these was the general belief that metal was sacred or that metal was a special material mostly used to denote social status, and the fact that metal edges were not as sharp as the far more common obsidian blades, which made them significantly less effective against the thick cotton armor often worn by Mesoamerican soldiers. It was not until the early colonial period that Mesoamerican smiths began the large scale production of metal implements, and even then it took decades for metal weapons to clearly eclipse their competitors."
 dat_animals: "European Animals"
 desc_dat_animals: "Mesoamerica, and indeed North America in general was completely devoid of any draft or transportation animals and the various advantages that they afforded the old world civilizations. The lack of such animals made control over vast territories difficult and severely complicated the logistics of supplying large armies, requiring any large force to be accompanied by a significant number of dedicated human porters, and forcing a plethora of organizational innovations and large scale development of a road system. \nWhen these animals arrived in Mesoamerica along with Europeans, they proved a significant change not only to military tactics but also to society at large."
